CHAPTER ONE<p>



I couldn't see the tourist as my eyes were closed, but I could sense his presence, even before he picked up the statuette of John The Baptist. It is near to the end of the season and at this time of year tourists are rare. Ha! Who am I trying to fool? They are rare any time of year these days. It was not always so. In the not too distant past, times were good. Yes, times were good, too good perhaps. That was before I lost my money, my dignity and my friend. My money and dignity have well and truly disappeared but my friend, I suppose, is still partially with me. He is mad and resides in a lunatic asylum. When he was first admitted he was as sane as you or me. (Presuming of course that you are as sane as I am, and that I am as sane as I think I am). But ten years in the asylum has turned him quite mad. A combination of soothing drugs and being surrounded night and day by screaming lunatics has taking its toll. As you would expect.
He was cast there on the recommendation of our illustrious police chief when caught seducing his wife. Perhaps to seduce the police chief's wife was an act of madness, but not quite madness itself; which is an altogether different ailment. The police chief could have had him arrested on some fictitious charge, (The charge would have had to be fictitious as it is not yet illegal to commit adultery, even with the wife of the police chief.) but he thought it would be far more entertaining to have him committed. 
Is it not heartening that in theses days of doom and gloom there are people still prepared to bring a little laughter into our lives?

The tourist is examining the statuette with great deliberation. My eyes are still closed but I can feel him turning the piece in his hands. Perhaps he is looking for identifying marks. Ha! He will find none. Without opening my eyes I tell him the price and he replaces it onto my stall like it was a hot coal. I'm determined to make a sale and will barter with him.<p>

	I always presumed that I would die young. How romantic that would have been. To say that I was a playboy in my youth may be a little misleading but I certainly lived it up and took many risks. There was a good chance I would end up crumpled behind the wheel of crashed automobile in the early hours, or shot by a bad loser during a poker game or murdered by a jealous husband in that other game of chance, adultery. But I survived. Not quite the three score and ten but a bonus besides. A lucky man? Perhaps. Of all the glamorous ways to die it looks as if I must content myself with 'Natural causes' I certainly won't be crushed in an automobile, I haven't driven, or been driven in over ten years. My gambling days have long since past and I will leave you to decide what my chances are, at seventy-four, to be discovered during an adulterous affair. Rather slim I would suggest.
To see me now, huddled in old rags behind my barrowload of bric-a-brac rubbish, it would be hard to imagine that I was once the purveyor of fine antiques and collectibles. 
It was my fathers business before mine and his fathers before him. I was fortunate to be 'born into money'. Not millionaires you understand but enough to give our family a certain amount of social standing in a country, which was by all accounts, considered by some to be part of the third world. I have had problems in the past understanding how a third world country can produce hardly enough food to feed itself and yet have such beautiful possessions within it's shores that it would be possible for families like mine to make their fortune from selling.
	A whore once asked me if I was proud of myself. I had to think for a moment. The question was not posed as an insult and had no bearing on a possible sexual liaison between us and there was no sarcasm intended. She meant was I proud of myself because I had been rich in a poor country. 'No' I answered. 'Not proud, but not ashamed either.'	
'You should be ashamed.' she replied. 'The rich should always be ashamed and the poor should be proud.'
'Why?' I asked, genuinely concerned.
'If you need to ask why, then you will never understand.'
Perhaps I should add that the whore hated me beyond reason even before that conversation. Did she hate me because I had been rich? No, she hated me because I had once loved her, sadly she had never loved me back. 
Incidentally, I still love her, despite the staggering gap between us of 39 years and her utter devotion to a man I detest almost to the degree that I love her. His name is Claude and he feeds me on coffee and rolls as I am no longer able to support myself from the paltry earnings of my junk stall. Why does he feed me knowing I despise him so intensely? I can tell you in one word. 
Guilt. 
Now there's a man who should be ashamed! Despite my hatred for him,  Claude feels nothing but warmth toward me but he despises the whore who spurns me but loves him. We make a curious trio. 
Claude's cafe is on the opposite side of the small piazza from my junk stall and the whore plies her trade by the arched entranced to the walled square. Before Claude, the cafe belonged to his father and before that, to his father's father. Before that Claude's ancestors had worked only on the land. His great grandfather had been totally against his son using hard earned family savings to open a cafe. He was proud of his farming even though the land was only rented and because of the extortionate demands of the landlords they would never be rich or even moderately well off. 
Even for a third world country.
'We are poor..' He explained to Claude's grandfather.'..but we are proud.' You see? It is not a new idea.
Despite these protestations Claude's grandfather went ahead and opened the cafe. It was tough because he had very little money to start such a business but he was a well-liked young man and he soon built up a regular clientele. His father refused to visit the cafe as it had been opened against his wishes. So to retaliate the son never visited his father. Not even with rolls and coffee! By comparison I don't do so badly. 
But here is another thing. Claude no longer visits his father. But that has nothing to do with retaliation. It has more to do with Claude's father being in a lunatic asylum! 
In those days the piazza was a focal point of the village. There were no tourists at this time. The package holiday was yet to be invented. Of course we would have the odd passing foreigner from time to time but these were true travellers who enjoyed the pure experience of discovering the ways and fancies of a different culture. When the tourism boom arrived all that became lost in a brave attempt to supply exactly what the tourists required, which was pretty much what they had left at home. They loved our warm climate and cheap alcohol but missed their home comforts. We grovelled at their feet and did our best to turn our home into theirs. I became very rich selling my home, or to be more precise the contents of my homeland, to them. Was I proud? Not proud, but not ashamed either.
So the piazza in those days would be full of poor, proud people having fun. Every night there would be singing and dancing, drinking and lovemaking and Claude's grandfather made a huge success of the cafe. My Grandfather's antique shop was then situated at the other end of town. It was demolished thirty years ago to make way for the building of The Hotel Continentale, which would cater for our islands flourishing tourist trade. By that time it was my antique shop. I was comfortably off, and indulging in my favourite pastimes of drinking, gambling and womanising. These sociable pleasures I used to pursue with the help and companionship of Claude's father. We had been friends since boyhood and have remained so to this day. I visit him in the lunatic asylum once a month. I never discuss his situation with Claude simply because Claude never asks. If he was to say 'How is my father keeping?' I would tell him. I would say 'He forgives you Claude and holds no grudge.' The words would stick in my throat, but I would tell him. But he doesn't ask. he is probably unaware that I even visit his father. Even his father is unaware that I visit him? His eyes have a distant look and I know he does not recognise me. I hope the police chief enjoys his joke.<p>

I ask for less and the tourist makes an excuse for not making a purchase, I come down a little more and still he refuses to buy. Instead he wants to eat and asks what time Claude's Cafe opens. He must be staying at the Hotel Continental, they have no dining facilities. 
I keep my eyes closed and refuse to answer. Why should I send business to Claude when it was his evidence, which assisted the police chief in his father's arrest. My lips are sealed and that is how Claude's should have been. The tourist does not give up easily though. When he asks for the third time, I tell him. 'Eight-o-clock.' It is now only six and he has two hours to wait. That gives him two hours to change his mind about buying the statuette.<p>


       <p><center> *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  </center><p>


I remember when the police chief was an ambitious young recruit. How we laughed at him, Claude's father and I, as he strutted around the piazza. His cap was too big, his sleeves were too short and his ridiculous dark glasses were worn even at night. He came from a poor family and his police uniform was probably the finest clothes he had ever worn. He rose very quickly through the ranks, not because he was a particularly good policeman but more because he was easily corruptible. This suited his employers who were, naturally, corrupt. Particularly the planning department.


<p><center> *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  </center><p>


The tourist has wiped grime from one of the cafe's windows and is trying to catch sight of Claude. Maybe he thinks Claude will open the cafe earlier if there is a waiting clientele. Ha! It's easy to see that he has never met Claude.
 'He is sleeping' I tell him. The tourist shrugs and walks back to my stall and picks up the statuette again. All is not lost!


<p><center> *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  </center><p>



The planning department has figured significantly in my life. If it were not for the planning department I may not have ended up where I am now. Perhaps I should not be so ungrateful, it could easily have been me in the lunatic asylum! The police chief hated me almost as much as he hated Claude's father. For years he had hoped to arrest either of us even for a minor misdemeanour, but we kept or noses clean and always just the right side of the law. 
As time went on and his frustrations with us grew along with his promotions, more and more petty laws were introduced to the point where it was almost possible to break the law without realising it. One needed a licence for this, a permit for that, permission for the other, it was like stepping through a minefield. What a mixture of emotions the police chief must have endured when confronted with the sight of Claude's father making love to his wife! The anger, the jealousy, the hatred but most of all the relief of at last being able to wreak his revenge. But it wasn't just Claude's father that was to suffer, the police chief's wife would also be made to endure a humiliating forfeit. 
She was a beautiful woman, and still is I might add, but foolish. Why would she ever want to marry a man such as him? Probably because he told her to.
 At the time of their marriage he had become a powerful man, not yet police chief but very close. She was young and full of life, a dancer at the nightclub below the Hotel Splendide. She had many friends and admirers and at that time Claude's father and myself were amongst them. She was much younger than we were. At this time she would have been only nineteen or twenty, Claude's father and I were already at the end of our fifties. Dirty old men? But of course, how else would we enjoy ourselves. She would sit at our table when she had finished dancing at the nightclub and drink Champagne and how we would laugh and joke. Those were very good times. We both fell in love with her, Claude's father and myself, and I think she loved us both a little too. I asked her to marry me one day when Claude's father was out of town. She laughed at me, not in a nasty way you understand, but in a way that was gentle and kind. In a way that would let me down lightly and not leave my pride bruised. She put her hand to my cheek and whispered 'I won't marry you, but if you like I will sleep with you.'
This took the wind from my sails. This was something I had fantasised about many times but I had to say no. Why? Now there you have me because I don't have a ready answer. Was it because I was worried about betraying my friendship with Claude's father? I doubt it. I'm sure if the offer had been made to him whilst I was out of town he would have jumped at it. Besides I'd asked her to marry me, wasn't that as bad, or possibly worse? was it maybe because something that is given so readily will perhaps be a disappointment? I wanted to spend my life with her to share my remaining years with her as my wife. An evening in her bed would not satisfy the yearning I had I my heart.

'Where else can I eat?' The tourist enquires turning the statuette in his hands. I open my eyes and look at him for the first time. He is smartly dressed but out of date. What few tourists visited us now are dressed in denims or sports wear, this man wore a light beige suit and a fedora. He is English and has that Englishman's air that carried them through the colonies in their hey day. That makes him seem elderly but he can be no more than thirty. He must have arrived here by aeroplane but could have just as easily have stepped from a time machine. Even his speech is a little dated. 'Do you speak English' He enquired, stooping toward me and using that loud voice the English reserve for speaking to foreigners. I speak it very well as I was taught as a child and have used it almost constantly ever since. I nod at him and he asks again if there is anywhere else to eat. Ha! If there was anywhere else to eat would Claude's restaurant still be in business? I think not. He wants to know about coffee shops or bars that may be open but everything would be closed now until eight-o-clock. That is our way.
'And the statuette?' I enquire. 'Have you decided to purchase it?'
He glares down at it lying in his hands as if it arrived there by magic and without his knowledge. He thumps it back down onto my barrow. 'It's broken'.
'Broken?' I ask incredulously
'Yes, broken. The head is missing'
'Missing? But of course it is missing you foolish man, it is John The Baptist.'

<p><center> *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  </center><p>



I discovered some years ago that when Claude returned from his out of town trip he also proposed marriage to her. Of all the women in the world how come we both loved the same one? But at least life was fair. She wanted to marry neither of us. I don't think that she made the same offer to Claude's father when he proposed that she made to me. She possibly made it much later though, which is partly why Claude's father is in the lunatic asylum! 
The man who was to become police chief, and her husband, would often visit the nightclub, in uniform and wearing the dark glasses of course. He also flirted with her but to start with she seemed to show little interest in him, unfortunately that changed when one of her uncles was arrested for supplying alcohol to the hotel without a licence. Up until the week that he was arrested a licence wasn't needed to supply alcohol to hotels. Particularly if your company was in the business of supplying alcohol to hotels, which his was. You see? He didn't even know he was breaking the law! He was more fortunate than Claude's father though, as all charges were mysteriously dropped thereby avoiding a ten-year prison sentence. I thought at the time that a ten year sentence was a little excessive for a first time offender who had broken the law unwittingly but all was revealed when a month later the future police chief became engaged to his future wife. Unlike Claude's father and myself, he had not been turned down. Ha! 
The wedding was a grand affair, I hear, and the reception was held in the restaurant of The Hotel Splendide. The Hotel that had previously employed the future police chief's wife, and was the buyer of alcohol from his wife's uncle. What an intricate web they wove! After the wedding he encouraged his new wife to abandon her night-club dancing career, or to be more precise forbade her to carry on, possibly to keep her distanced from people like myself and Claude's father. We were not invited to the wedding needless to say. We also didn't keep distanced.

Looking around as if a restaurant might possibly appear from thin air, the tourist explains that he is indeed staying at The Hotel Continental, which much to his surprise, offered no dining facilities. He seems about to resign himself to waiting for Caude's establishment to open when he spots the small water fountain situated on the wall by the arch. He asks if the water emitted from the concrete cherub's mouth is drinkable. I tell him the water is as clear as crystal, as pure as melted glacier, as sweet as a mountain stream but unfortunately the fountain, like most things in this town, does not work.
'Are you blind?' he asks in puzzlement 'I can see the water trickling into the bowl, and water flowing from a fountain is usually a good sign that it actually works.'
He was going to be a difficult man to convince.
'Don't take my word for it.' I say 'Try for yourself.'
He suspects a trick, that I can see from the expression on his face. 'Go ahead, I won't move from this spot.' I assure him
Gingerly he moves towards the fountain and positions his mouth below the running water but just as he is in reach, the flow stops. He pulls back and looks with a frown at the fountain. It begins to flow again quite freely. he gets closer and once more it stops. He tries this a few more times before accepting the inevitable then turns to me and speaks.
 'Eight-o- clock you say?'
'Or thereabouts.' I reply. then we both jump out of our skin as Rula appears through the archway and throws her bicycle crashing to the ground. Several loaves of bread tip out from  a basket fixed to the handlebars, she kicks them aside and stamps across the square to hammer loudly on the cafe door yelling out for Claude. She seems upset.




CHAPTER TWO<p>


The marriage has never been a happy one. She didn't love him of course. It was a marriage of convenience. She married him and her uncle was set free. Very convenient for her uncle. 
On the eve of the wedding Claude's father and I sat in the cafe and drank ourselves into a state of drunken stupidity. It was a tragedy. The woman we both loved had married a man we both hated. Claude himself, who at this time was working for his father, served us the drinks with an air of gross disapproval. By the time we had slipped from our barstools to the floor our plan had been formed. The only answer was to shoot the future police chief. He would never bother us again and his widow would be free to marry one of us. Why at this time we thought that she would want to marry us when we she had turned us both down previously is difficult to understand in the cold light of day. And of course we had only assumed she would be pleased with us for shooting her new husband. Perhaps this was a lot to assume. Had we been sober this may still have seemed like a very good idea. But had we been sober I doubt that we would have been prepared to carry it out. However, we managed to get ungracefully to our feet and Claude's father went to fetch a revolver from a locked drawer in his bedroom. I kept Claude occupied to distract his attention. He was not to know of our plan. It would not be fair to involve him just in case things went wrong. In fact things started going wrong very quickly. To keep the pistol from Claude's view his father had pushed it into the waistband of his trousers but as he stumbled back from the bedroom it slipped down his trouser leg and clattered to the floor. All three of us stared at the gun but Claude was the first to speak.
'Are you mad? Are the two of you quite insane?' Claude could not have known how prophetic those words would be. Claude's father stood with his head hung low whilst Claude shouted and ranted about how foolish we were and that at our age how we should know better than to roam the streets with a loaded pistol. He flung a glass drying cloth to the bar and stomped round to our side. He must have felt that prodding his father in the chest with his forefinger would better put over his point of view. Claude's father obviously disagreed and slugged him. Even in a drunken state Claude's father could pack a powerful punch. Claude crumpled to the floor in a daze, his father picked up the pistol and tucked it back into his waistband, and we headed for The Hotel Splendide.

'He's asleep.' The tourist tells Rula. She stops hammering on the door and turns to face him.
'I know he is asleep, moron. That is why I am hammering so loudly, to wake him up.'
Rula works for Claude. She is laughingly called a chef. They met when Claude was on vacation in Paris. How he managed to afford a vacation in Paris when he can barely afford to live at home is beyond me. Anyway, his finances are not my affair.
Rula was being forcible ejected from the kitchens of a cheap restaurant as Claude was passing by the door. Apparently as she landed at his feet a loud cheer was heard from the restaurant's patrons. Surely that should have served a warning to Claude that her cooking was not really up to scratch. Apparently not, for after helping her to her feet and she had related the sad tale of her poor treatment by the Parisian diners, he offered her a job at his cafe. He assured her that although the basic salary would be low she would enjoy an equal share of the profits. Ha! If only she had known how small the profits were.
'Come out here Claude,' She continues screaming. 'I have something to tell you.'
'It sounds like you have something to tell the entire world.' I say. She then turns to face me, her face is screwed up and snarling. She is not a pretty woman.
'And who asked for your advice you disgusting wretch?'
'We have here a curious situation.' I say to  tourist. 'I hate the restaurateur, who adores me. He hates the whore whom I love but who detests me. But she loves the restaurateur, and so on.' I point to the chef. 'And this is Rula. She hates everybody.'
'I hate no one.' She spits back. The tourist moves toward her with his hand outstretched.
'How do you do? My name is Toby.'
"Toby, Schmoby.' She mumbles, pushing his hand aside and picking up her bicycle.
'You should be a little more civil to ahhh....Toby.' I point out. ' He is hoping to eat at your fabulous cafe tonight. Don't scare away what could be your only client' I chortle and it turns into a rattling cough.
'I hope you choke you old fool. Besides he won't be one of my clients. I quit.'
'You have had a better offer?' I quip, this time combining my laughing and a coughing.
'What business is it of yours what offers I have? Do you know what they called me in Paris? She throws the bicycle against the wall and pushes her face almost into mine. 'do you know old man? THE LITTLE MAGICIAN! That is what they called me.  From scraps I would produce food fit for a king.' 
'Now we know why France had the revolution.' I say, pushing her away from me. She spits on the dusty ground and stands her bicycle upright. This done she crosses once more to the cafe door and thumps loudly yelling for Claude to open up.
'I could always pass on a note for you.' Toby offers. she turns angrily to him.
'I could pin a note on the door, you half wit. I want to see him. I want him to beg me to stay, I want him to grovel. I want him to plead on his knees, I want him to offer me the world and then I shall throw it back in his face. All this I want to see. UNDERSTAND!? Besides, my suitcase is in there.'
Toby sits himself at one of the cafe tables and fans his face with the fedora. Rula continues banging on the door for a few moments to no avail.
'He sleeps like the dead.' she says to no one in particular, as she turns away. 'Only a man with no conscience can sleep like that.'
Perhaps she is right. In fact, Claude is almost certainly a man without conscience.
'Why did you leave the cafe in Paris?' Toby asks her.
'Huh! Again, they didn't appreciate my talents. Men! Their bruised little egos couldn't stand the thought that a mere female could be such a successful chef.'
'Wouldn't a successful chef have kept their job?' I ask.
'Of course they would.' She almost screams at me. But they were men weren't they? That's the sort of treatment women put up with.' She turns to Toby. 'Do you know, the waiters were so put out by my success that they forsook their free lunches and ate elsewhere! Can you believe that?
'Er..No I suppose not.' He replies.
'It is beyond believing' I add.
She turns on me. 'And what would you know? You with your barrow load of junk. What right have you to comment on the way I run my life? At least I have ambition. you just sit there and bark like a little doggie that takes two steps back whilst trying to look so brave. You think that as you have no home, no money and no hope that you are as low as you can get.' Her face pushes into mine again. 'But don't you believe it. No matter how low down you are there is always a little further to go.'
It is so difficult to learn anything new these days. people only tell me things I already know.

How Claude's father and I even managed to get as far as the hotel in our intoxicated state is a mystery, but once there we realise that we had not at this stage organised a plan of action. We slumped onto the grass beside the hotel and began to discuss the best way to shoot the future police chief.
Firing at him as he left the hotel with his new wife was to be discounted in case we missed him and got her instead. That would leave us in the soup. I think it was Claude's father that actually came up with the most sensible idea. We would phone the hotel from a call box and leave a message for him that the police station was on fire and he should get there as soon as possible. We surmised that he would rush from the hotel on his own and in a blinding hurry and as he climbed into his car we would strike.
This plan failed miserably on several counts. Count one: neither of us had change for the call box. Count two: The only adjacent call box was out of order anyway, and count three: The gun must have slipped once more, although unnoticed this time, down the trouser leg and was now laying on the ground somewhere between the cafe and the hotel. We re-traced our steps three times before we found it.
Even with these drawbacks we were determined for the plan to go ahead but we had to find a way to coax him out into the open. We had sat ourselves on a wooden bench at the rear of the hotel, which was mostly in shadow. Almost as we had despaired of finding an answer a shaft of light swept across the hotel lawn as a rear fire door opened. We could hardly believe our eyes. Framed in the door frame was the future police chief. We watched in silence as he placed a cigar in his mouth and clicked a lighter. Claude's father eased the pistol from his jacket pocket. Silhouetted in the doorway was the perfect target. The lighter continued clicking but refused to light, he looked up and must have seen us both sitting on the bench.
'Why what have we here?' He said walking slowly towards us. 'Loiterers? I do hope you were not offended by the absence of a wedding invitation.'
'Of course not'. Said Claude's father. 'We were busy anyway.'
'Busy sitting on park benches I see.' He stood above us looking down as if we were already arrested and under questioning. Even thought the evening air was cool; I began to sweat as I thought of the gun nestling in the lap of Claude's father hidden only by the flap of his jacket.
'So have you left your new bride already' I asked, hoping to divert his gaze to me.
'Not at all. but it is such a beautiful evening I couldn't resist a stroll. My wife - you notice how easily I refer to her as my wife already? - finds cigar smoke unpleasant. So I thought I would take this opportunity to have a smoke.'
He pulled two more cigars from his top pocket. 'Perhaps you gentleman would like to join me.' He offered them to us.
'Thank you, but no.' I said. 'Neither of us smoke'
'How commendable' he said, perhaps by not smoking you aim to live a little longer?'
'Certainly longer than you' Claude's father chipped in.
'I doubt it, you are both so much older than I am. Now, if you won't share a cigar with me perhaps I could trouble you for a light'
'But of course.' Claude's father said rising from the bench. 'Nothing would give me greater pleasure.' And before I knew it the pistol was raised towards the future police chief's face. then almost as one movement the cigar was placed between his lips as the pistol was fired...... and let out a hollow click! Then another...then one more.
The cigar was removed from his mouth and he turned to walk away. ' Huh! it's just like my lighter - it doesn't work.' We watched him as he disappeared back through the lighted doorway. The door closed behind him and what had been a gash of yellow light across the lawn returned once more to darkness.
'The bullets!' Claudes father said, almost as a sob. 'I forgot the damn bullets.' Ha! so much for the gunfight at O.K. Corral!

'And what about you Toby? Do you have ambition' I ask. A puzzled look passes across his face.
'I suppose all my ambitions are involved with my work.'
'And what is your work?' Rula says as she peers through one of the grimy cafe windows.
'Insurance. I settle insurance claims.'
'That must be very expensive for you.' I quip. But he misunderstands.
'Ah! No.' He says with a condescending smile. I don't settle them myself. What I meant was that I work for an insurance company, and it is my job within that company, so to speak, to settle any claims that are made against the company, as it were. Do you see?'
'Perfectly.' I shrugged. This was probably one of the most boring people I had ever met.
'CLAUDE! OPEN UP!' Rula screams, hammering once more on the cafe door, and at last his ugly tousled head appears from the first floor window.'
'Who's making all that racket? I'm trying to sleep.'
'ME, ME, ME. I am making all this racket'
'Well if you don't stop consider yourself fired.'
'No, Claude, you consider yourself without a chef. I QUIT!'
This brought Claude to his senses. 'Quit?.... Quit? You can't quit.'
'Yes I can. And I just did. See how you get on now you miserable pig.'
'We can talk about this Rula.'
'No we can't. I'm off.' She turns to leave.
'Wait.' He yells 'I'll give you another ten a week.'
She spits on the ground again. I'd never noticed until today what a spitter she is. I'm glad I'd never tasted the soup whilst she'd been the chef.
'I spit on your ten.' 
'Fifteen?'
'Pah!' As she was about to climb on the bicycle.
'O.k.. O.k. My last offer, twenty.'
The bicycle was thrown to the ground again. 'You think you can buy the magician with your empty promises? YOU DON'T DESERVE A CHEF LIKE ME. You are pig-headed, ignorant, mean, stupid and couldn't run a restaurant if your life depended on it, and if I ever see your ugly face again I'll......'
'Wait......Wait..' Claude protested. 'There has obviously been some misunderstanding. Wait I'm coming down.'
His grubby little head disappears from the window and moments later he is fawning all over Rula.

'Rula, Rula, you  are so right. How I have mistreated you, but all that will be put right. Now why don't we have a drink and talk things over?'
She prodded his chest on every word. 'I have nothing more to discuss. You are a pig and I quit. I am going to pack my case and then I will be gone.'
She pushes him aside and enters the cafe. He looks very sorry for himself. 'What have I done to deserve this?'
'Almost everything Claude.' I say, but he is not listening.
'Do I treat my staff badly? She has two hours off every afternoon, what more does she want? Maybe I'm a little delayed in paying her wages but times are hard right now. She should have a little patience.' He sits on one of his cafe chairs with his head in his hands.
'Nobody realises how difficult it is to get staff these days. Is there no justice in this world?'
'Ask your father Claude. He knows all about Justice.'
He looks up at me. 'You always have to bring that up don't you? Do you think I enjoyed doing such a thing? I had no choice.'
'We all have a choice Claude.'
'You don't know him like I do. you think you know him because he was such a friend of yours, but you don't. He never treated me like a son. You never saw the most of it. Do you know he punched me once?'
'Yes.' I say. ' I was there. And you deserved it. I'm sorry I didn't do it myself.'
'No, you wouldn't have done it. You are not like him. He could have broken my jaw.'
'You were prodding him in the chest.'
'He breaks my jaw for prodding him in the chest? What sort of father is that?'.
'He thought the world of you.' I tell him.
'Huh! That's a good one. And what about.....'
I knew what he was going to say and interrupted him.
'That was an accident Claude and you know it.'
'So you say, I'm not so sure.'
He sits at one of the cafe tables, takes a cigarette from his waistcoat pocket and lights it. Before it is half smoked Rula comes out of the cafe carrying two small suitcases. Claude jumps up as he sees her. 'Rula, Rula, I have just thought of something.' She turns to him as he almost whispers to her.
'Is it a bad time of the month for you?'
She lets the suitcases drop to the ground and slaps him hard across the left cheek.
'No my friend, it is a bad time of the month for you.' She picks up her suitcases again and storms from the piazza. I think that is the last we shall see of Rula.






CHAPTER THREE<p>


Claude's father and I shuffled back toward the bar. That was it now. We had tried and failed. We had to face up to the fact that we were not cut out to be assassins. We were far more successful at drinking and womanising. By this time we had sobered up somewhat and the whole episode was beginning to look fairly ridiculous. For one thing, if we had shot him Claude's father and I would have been the prime suspects. It was no secret that we were jealous of his marriage.
We moved to the bar feeling morose and beginning to sober up. Claude poured us both a large brandy.
His chin was looking quite bruised and he seemed to be in a little pain as he asked if we'd managed to shoot anybody. His father told him that we had never intended shooting anybody but had taken the pistol with us merely as a form of protection. Claude tutted loudly in disbelief, stopped wiping the glasses and served us both a drink. Claude was about twenty-five at this time and had a full head of hair which he has since lost. He now combs a few greasy strands across his balding pate in the mistaken belief that it makes him look more hirsute. Perhaps I am being a little insensitive here as I still have all my hair, although it is now completely white. He was also much slimmer in those days and usually to be found behind the cafe bar. He seemed to have little in the way of social life and kept pretty much to himself, as he does now. Claude's mother had died when he was only two years old and his father was thirty-two. She was a beautiful woman with a strong will and forceful personality, after a short illness she passed away in her sleep. Claude's father had been devastated but had somehow kept his business going whilst bringing up a young son single handedly. It was strange then that they had never been truly close. As an adult he disapproved of his father's ways but even at that time he somehow saw me as the innocent who had been led into bad ways. 
'You should both grow up' Claude said. 'I know exactly what you were up to and if I'd thought there was the remotest chance that you would succeed I would have made sure I stopped you. I presume you made complete fools of yourselves as usual?'
'Not at all.' Claude's father answered. 'We had a pleasant chat in the grounds of the hotel, smoked a cigar then made our way back here.'
'That's another lie, you don't smoke.'
'We don't but he did. Almost did I should say'
'What do you mean?' Claude asked.
His father pulled the pistol once more from his jacket pocket.
'I was going to shoot him and he thought this was a cigarette lighter.'
'Is it?' Claude asked.
'Of course not, it just wasn't loaded.' He clicked the trigger to demonstrate and almost blew Claude's head off. The sound was deafening and the huge mirror behind the bar fell into a thousand tiny shards. Claude crumpled into a heap and his father and I fell from our barstools onto the floor. The air filled with a mixture of dust, smoke and the thick stench of cordite, then there was a momentary silence.
'Claude, Claude, I've killed Claude' His father howled.
'It's all right.' I assured him. 'The bullet was too high to hit him, he's just fainted.' We both rushed to the other side of the bar and I splashed water onto Claude's face and his father fanned him with a bar towel until, coughing and spluttering, he came round.
'Am I hurt badly.' He whispered as he regained consciousness.
'You are not hurt at all.' I said.
'My own father! Shot by my own father.'
'You are not hit Claude, I missed.' His father said guiltily.
'You think that makes me feel better? That you missed?'
'He wasn't even aiming at you.' I said 'He thought the gun was empty.'
'First he fractures my jaw, then when that doesn't work he shoots me. What kind of father do I have?'
'Claude, I'm sorry, it was an accident. Here, let me help you up.'
We each took an arm, helped him to his feet and dusted him off. He grumbled and moaned for a little longer but eventually calmed down.  
On the whole it had been a pretty unsuccessful evening. I thought I would cut my losses and head home to bed. I bade my farewells and left the two of them to resolve their family dispute. As I walked to the door I spotted the pistol lying on the floor. I picked it up and on the way back to my villa, I climbed onto the sea wall and tossed it as hard as I could into the calm black waters. Before we did any real damage.

Toby cleared his throat and said. 'Gosh! Look Claude seven forty five. It'll soon be time to open?'
Claude looked at Toby and even though they had been sitting at the same table Claude seemed to have not noticed his presence until now.
'Do I know you?' He asks gruffly.
'Well, no, we haven't exactly been introduced.'
'Then I suggest you conduct yourself with a little decorum we have certain rules about serving riff raff.'
'I was hoping to eat at your restaurant tonight.'
'That's as maybe but that does not mean that we are on first name terms. As for the restaurant, I am afraid I may be a little delayed in opening tonight as I have encountered a slight problem with staff. I'm afraid we don't take bookings, you will have to take a chance on there being a free table.' 
'You certainly know how to make your clients feel welcome Claude.' I comment.
'I'm not going to bow and scrape to them. How long do you think I would survive in business if I gave into them all the time?'
'I wasn't aware that you were surviving in business. I don't see much business going on.'
'I do alright.' He protested. 'It's the quiet season right now, things will pick up again.'
'Who are you trying to kid Claude.' I say. 
His fists are clenched by his sides. 'You don't understand, you just don't understand. I..... Dohh..I'm going to the kitchen.' And he heads back inside the cafe but as an afterthought picks up the bread first that Rula threw to the floor.
'Poor Claude,' I say to Toby. 'if only he could see the error of his ways. He is such a disagreeable little man.'
'Oh, I don't know. He doesn't seem too bad. I feel a bit sorry for him really, it seems like he's going to be stuck without Rula. Are you sure there is nowhere else I can eat?'
'There used to be many restaurants,' I tell him. 'but they are all closed now. You must be newly arrived and still finding your way about'
'Yes, is it what you would call a lively place?' He asks.
'Lively? No, I would not call it lively.'
'Peaceful?'
'Not peaceful, you will often hear voices raised.'
'Is there a night-club?'
'Not as such.' I tell him
'What do you mean -"Not as such."'
I beckon him to come a little closer. 'I take it that you mean the kind of place where there are roulette wheels, dancing, cabaret, that sort of thing?'
'Yes, yes,' He says excitedly. 'that's the sort of thing.'
'A night-club just like that exists below the hotel Splendide.'
'That's more like it.' He says rubbing his hands. ' That's just what I need. And tell me, does this night club have a restaurant by any chance?'
'Oh yes, a fine restaurant. Crystal chandeliers, gleaming white tablecloths and a superb menu. The most respected restaurant in the area.'
'And what time do they open?' He asks suspiciously.
'Eight thirty.'
'And they are not closed for repairs?'
'Not to my knowledge.'
'A restaurant and a night-club?'
'That is correct.'
'Excellent food, dancing, cabaret and gaming tables?'
'So I am led to believe.'
'Then why on earth didn't you tell....' And here he paused for a moment. '...There's going to be a catch isn't there? I'm going to get all excited about this, then you are going to give me some ridiculous reason why I can't go there.'
'It's not my ridiculous reason.' I smile.

Claude's father and I became a lot more sensible after the shooting incident. It was time we grew up. After all we were both in our fifties now. We had to start taking life seriously. That is when we planned our big business venture.
A new hotel was to be built opposite the Splendide to cope with the booming tourist trade. It was to be called the Continental and would have gift shops and cafes incorporated into the building making it a very fine affair. This would obviously take business away from the end of town where the cafe , which still belonged to Claude's father, was situated. And so our plan was to develop the piazza. Oh what fine ideas we had. The cafe would be enlarged into a proper restaurant, five new shops would be built, several market stalls would sell gifts, sweets and trinkets, tree's would be planted and gardens landscaped. But best of all would be the nightclub! A fine affair which would even put the Hotel Splendide's to shame.
It was an enormous task to take on but we felt confident we could make it work. And so we might have done if it were not for the planning department.
Of course, it was going to take an enormous amount of money and we had thought very carefully about this. We both had savings, not a fortune, but fairly considerable, and I also had my antique shop; inherited from my father. The shop stood on land that the new hotel was to be built on. They wanted me out. I could see a way that this would be to everyone's advantage. The new hotel could have my land and the money they paid me would help finance our new development at the piazza. After much negotiation a deal was struck and I was made a very good offer. Signed, sealed and delivered. I managed to sell off the remainder of my stock wholesale and on the 29th November 1981 locked up my shop for the last time. Once the new development was complete I could open a new shop in the piazza. These were exciting times.
The next step was for Claude's father and myself to purchase the freehold of the piazza. We wanted to do this without attracting too much attention to ourselves. If it was thought that a business already situated in the piazza was involved in the purchase there was a good chance that the cost of the freehold would be kept artificially high. So we told no one of our plans, not even Claude. We took a trip to the mainland together, formed a partnership and registered a new company name: Day-one Developments. We also employed the services of a lawyer on the mainland. To use one from the island was tantamount to taking out newspaper space to advertise our plans. We instructed him to begin negotiations for the purchase of the freehold. Claude's father assumed the freehold belonged to the local authorities and passed on that information to the lawyer, it would be up to him to check that out and ascertain if this were the case or not. 
Our business then was completed for the time being and we decided to book into a small hotel and take the morning boat back. And so we had the evening before us to enjoy. We decided on a slap-up meal, A little dancing at a club we had frequented once or twice before and then perhaps a discreet visit to our favourite bordello. What a dash we cut in those days. We stepped out in our smart navy blazers and taupe trousers with a carnation in our lapels and an air of confidence in our strides. At that time I sported a neat, clipped moustache and Claude's father wore a trim goatee, we were men about town with money in our pocket and an eye on the future. How different our future turned out to be!

'I knew it. I knew it.' Toby whined. 'I just bloodywell knew it. Come on then. What's the catch? what's to stop me visiting this all singing, all dancing extravaganza of entertainment?' 
'There is a certain rivalry between the two hotels.' I explain. 'Because you are not staying at the Hotel Splendide, they will not allow you to use their facilities.'
'No problem' He grins, 'I will change hotels. It is probably more expensive but I can stretch myself a little.'
'That will be difficult.'
'To stretch myself a little?' He asks.
'No, to change hotels.'
'Why should it be difficult?'
'Once you have booked into a rival hotel, the Splendide feel you have no loyalty to them and so would rather refuse your custom.'
'I don't believe this.' He says incredulously. 'Loyalty? We are talking about an hotel here, not the French Foreign Legion! Why should they care who is loyal or not as long as the bill is paid?'
'It's easy to see you are from the world of commerce.'
'And I'm not sure I'll be sorry to get back there. So in effect it will be impossible for me to either eat at the Hotel Splendide or enjoy the delights of their night-club?'
'I'm afraid so, yes.'
'So where do you suggest I go for entertainment?'
'Why go anywhere Toby. Entertainment you can have right here, in the piazza.'
He looks about him in an exaggerated fashion. 'I see no gaming tables, I hear no music and there is no dancing. Do you have a set of dominoes?'
'Dominoes are not needed' I tell him sincerely. 'when there is Pasha!'
'Pasha?'
'Yes, Pasha the whore.'
'The Whore!'
'The Whore! The whore!'
'Correct.' I tell him.
He looked a little indignant. 'When I was talking about an evening's entertainment I wasn't considering groping about on grubby sheets with a cheap...........Well...Whore!'
'Who said cheap? and you certainly wouldn't have to put up with grubby sheets.'
'Whatever, it's not my idea of an evening's fun. It's sordid.'
How could anything with Pasha ever be sordid? I am incensed.
'How can it be sordid? If your car breaks down you call a mechanic, If your sink blocks you send for a plumber, if your lights fail fetch an electrician and if you want sex you use a whore. It's a job like any other.'
'Aha!' He yelps irritatingly. 'You have hit the nail right on the head. You call the mechanic, you send for a plumber and you fetch an electrician. But the whore you use! Do you see my point?'
There is no point to see as far as I'm concerned, but I let him continue.
'I don't want to use somebody, even if it is their job.' His eyes glazed over a little. 'When I make love I want it to be a beautiful experience between clean white sheets and with a bottle of chilled French champagne, and she would be dressed in pure silk with an aura of expensive perfume. She would coo affectionately in my ear and look deep into my eyes.........Not at her watch!'
'You tourists expect a lot from a weeks vacation.' I muse. 'Besides, Pasha doesn't wear a watch.'
He is obviously still trying to think of a way to get into the Hotel Splendide, as he asks about the possibility of using a false name but as he is part way through a sentence Claude crashes out of the cafe door carrying my rolls and coffee. At least Rula's departure has not affected my supper!
'My God what a mess she has left the kitchen in. It'll take me at least a month to get that put straight.'
'My heart bleeds for you Claude.' I say taking the food and coffee from him.
'Nobody wants to do a fair day's work for a fair days pay anymore.'
'How right you are, good staff are hard to find. I've been advertising for weeks.' He ignores my quip.
'I feed her, give her a nice room with plenty of space, ample free time.' He raises his hands in a gesture of non-comprehension. 'Is there no justice my friend?'
'I'm not sure, I'll check with your father next time I see him.'
'Tchh. Drink you coffee before it gets cold.'
I pass one of my rolls to Toby which he grabs hungrily but before it reaches his mouth Claude snatches it back and thumps it back down on my plate. 'What are you doing! Feeding my customers before they even reach the table? You want to see him sitting in my restaurant all night just drinking soup? You are not content to go broke yourself - you want to see me bankrupt too.'
Toby looks guiltily at Claude. 'I didn't mean to offend you and I certainly wouldn't have only ordered soup. In fact I can't wait to order just about anything.'
'A little patience if you please sir.' Claude tells him. 'That is all that is required. The restaurant will be opening very soon. But please, do not take food from this man. If I do not feed him he will starve.'
'What a philanthropist you are Claude.' I shout. 'Perhaps we ought to erect a statue of you in the piazza - then the pigeons could shit on it.' I take an angry bite from the roll. 'If we had any pigeons.' I add as an afterthought.
To my surprise Claude places an arm around Toby's shoulder. 'Do not take too much heed to what our friend the junkman says. He is a broken man......'
I interrupt him. 'Broke perhaps Claude, but not broken.'
'....who had a bad business deal. He now takes out his misfortune on the rest of the world. But believe me he is a kind man who means no ill.'
What does Claude know of how kind I am. I've certainly never been kind to him! He continues to give Toby a potted history of my life and why should I stop him? It makes no odds to me.
'Don't bore the poor man Claude, he may wander off before you get a chance to feed him.'
'His bark is worse than his bite,' Claude tells him. 'And he feels bitterness because of what happened to his business venture.'
'How would you know what I feel Claude?' In fact you are wrong, I do not feel bitter. Unfortunately I feel nothing at all anymore. I am completely devoid of all feeling.'
'That is impossible.' He says making his way back toward the cafe. 'Just as it is impossible to empty one's head of all thought.' He turns to face me before going in. 'But when you think that all feelings have gone - then it is only bitterness that remains.'  I can see he wants to make a dignified exit from this conversation, he rattles on the handle but the cafe door is not going to budge. I have to stifle a giggle as he realises that the door must have locked behind him. He tries to pretend that it's quite normal for him to step up on a chair and climb through the ground floor window but it is an amusing sight and he does it without further comment.

I have lived on this island all my life, all seventy-four years of it. Claude's father and I grew up as boy's together and my father and his father grew up as boys together. That's how life was on small islands. Things are different now of course. My father would not have expected me to end up as I have. Ha! Even I didn't expect to end up as I have. My mother, sadly, I do not remember. Do not misunderstand me, it's not that she died young, or ran off and left us when I was a child, it's quite simply that I do not remember her. I know she must have been around of course, as our meals were cooked and the beds were made and the house was cleaned and our socks were darned; but whether her hair was dark or fair, whether she were tall or short, if she were fat or thin - I'm afraid I'm at a loss to remember.
My father I remember very well. He was a large fellow with a bushy grey beard and shoulders a yard wide. It was impossible for him to talk quietly, every word would boom out from the depths of his huge chest. He was always laughing with never a bad word for anybody. Oh how I loved that man. I particularly remember one bright spring day he took me fishing with him. It was the first time I had been out on the sea, I suppose I must have been, perhaps, three or four years old. He rowed away from the shore and his bronzed muscles rippled with every stroke. I think I must have been a little frightened as the shoreline became a blur in the distance and the sea rocked the tiny boat to and fro but it was a fear mixed with great excitement.
We had taken sandwiches with us, (which I presume my mother had made) bottled beer for my father and pop for me, and when we reached the spot from where my father wanted to fish, we first ate our lunch. How grown up I felt with my very own packed lunch with fruit and a chocolate biscuit. My father never fussed over me, he always let me get on with things in my own way and in my own time. I was still eating when he cast his line out over the clear blue water but by the time he had pulled the first few fish from his hook I had folded my sandwich wrapping neatly, brushed the crumbs from my jersey and tucked the fruit peel into a paper bag. A smile from my father told me I had done everything properly.
It was a very warm day and I think I must have dozed a little as father fished but I was jerked into wakefulness very abruptly as father half stood and shouted at a huge fish on the end of his line. The boat rocked quite violently as father pulled and tugged the creature closer to us. 'Come on in you brute.' He hollered at it. 'Look at this boy! Look at the size of him.' 
I clung on tightly to the side of the boat in case I should be tipped out, and looked in awe at the slapping, wrestling fish. I'd never seen my father so excited, he was grinning from ear to ear, and his face was as red as beetroot.
'Come on in you brute, come on in.' He kept calling, though I could hardly hear his voice for the sound of the thrashing the fish was making. It must have taken father a good fifteen minutes to land it into the boat, and land it did with a crashing thump. Father whooped and lifted it with both hands. 'What do you think boy, just look at the brute. So what shall we have for tea tonight? Pork chops or this fine fellow?'
He must have seen something in my face. I'd never given it a thought, that we might actually eat the fish. It looked so beautiful, I have always loved beauty. A tear must have crept into my eye as I saw the poor creature struggling on the boat floor. 'I'm rather partial to pork chops lad, what say you?' I nodded dumbly. I didn't feel grown up anymore. I felt just like the little boy I was. Father linked his hands firmly beneath the fish and lowered him back into the sea. There was a wild thrashing as it swam away. I'm certain that it looked back at us before disappearing beneath the waves, but I was a young boy with a vivid imagination.

I often used to think of that day as I looked over the ocean from my villa garden, rocking to and fro in the wide cushioned swing, which I had strung from a willow tree bough.  I believe it was that particular episode of my life, which filled my mind on the day that Claude's father came running and shouting toward me waving a large wad of papers. It was about a month after our return from the mainland and I had just finished a cool beer beneath my willow. With the shop sold I was, for the moment at least, a man of leisure.
'You won't believe this, you won't believe it' I heard him shout as he drew closer. I rose and walked toward him.
'Believe what man? What are you so excited about?'
He tried to get his breath back before answering and leaned forward with his hands on his knees. Then as he stood back upright I could see a mixture of pain and anger on his face.
'What on earth is it?' I asked again. He shook the papers at me. He was so angry the words would hardly pass his lips.
'These are from the solicitor.' I still couldn't see what the excitement was about, and how was I expected to guess. I simply shrugged my shoulders. this seemed to make him even angrier.
'It's about the freehold.' He spat. 'The freehold is owned by Claude!'
'Claude?' I was shocked 'Claude? But how?'
'You might well ask' He slumped onto the grass exhausted.
'But how?' I asked again. 'Where did he get the money from?'
He turned to me and with real malice in his voice said.
'He must have stolen it from me. From the cafe takings. But that is not the worst of it. He is not alone. He has a partner.'
'A partner?' I said in disbelief. 'But who?'
Claude's father placed his head between his hands.
'Our friend the police chief.' He sobbed 'Can you believe that?'

Toby looks a little sheepish 'I'm sorry your business venture failed. I feel a bit guilty about not buying the statuette now.'
'Forget it.' I tell him. 'It is only junk anyway.'
'Did you lose a lot of money?'
'But of course. All of it. Take my advice Toby, never go into business with a friend - particularly if he ends up in a lunatic asylum.'
'Claude's father?' He says with surprise.
'Exactly.'
'But you don't feel bitter.' He asks.
'A little, but I suppose that is to be expected.'
He sits again on the wall around the drinking fountain. From the corner of my eye I notice a movement through the archway. My heart races; it must be Pasha. As she walks across the square I find I am unable to refrain from calling quietly to her. 'Pasha my dear, you are so very beautiful.'
'Swine.' She spits back as she casually leans against the wall.
'Toby, this is Pasha, this is the beautiful woman I have told you about.'
He looks around at her and removes his hat. He looks puzzled for a moment then he realises who she is. ' Oh! the wh.... The er...Yes, yes of course, the lady you mentioned earlier.
How do you do?'
'Do you have a cigarette' she almost snarls.
'I'm very sorry, I'm afraid I don't smoke.' Toby says, and for some reason he is patting his pockets. I presume that this is meant to convince us that he is definitely not  carrying a pack of cigarettes. It makes him look like a conjuror proving to an audience that a vanished rabbit is nowhere about his person.
'Nobody smokes anymore,' pasha scowls. 'they are afraid of dying, for some reason they think it is going to be worse than living.'
'My dad died because he gave up smoking.' Toby said, standing up. 'He threw what was to be his last packet of twenty into the Thames but slipped and followed them in. Poor father drowned.'
'Is your mother still alive?' I ask.
'Oh yes, alive and well. We still share the same house actually. I suppose by now I should have my own place but I don't like to leave her on her own. To be perfectly honest, this is the first time I've been on holiday without her.'
'How old are?' Pasha asks.
'Thirty four.' He looks down at his feet, a little embarrassed. 'Thirty four today as a matter of fact.'
'Happy birthday.' Says Pasha without feeling. 'You've certainly picked some place to spend it. Whereabouts are you staying?'
'The Continental'
'Yechh, even worse.'
'Toby is a potential client of yours Pasha.' This makes her brighten a little. And she moves toward him.
'Really, Then I must tell him all about myself.' Toby moves back slightly as she touches his arm. he looks terrified.'
'It's twenty for one position, thirty for two, or forty if you want me to undress. Cash only.'
'Ahhh....... No thank you,' He stammers. 'I ..er..No..It's not quite what I was planning for the evening.'
'What were you planning?' She purrs at him. 'There's really not a lot else to do here.'
'Eat. I was planning to eat, here at Claude's restaurant.' He points at the cafe as if we don't realise it's there.
'Claude is such a lovely man,' She tells Toby. 'he is somebody that could have my services free of charge. Unfortunately for me he does not want them.'
'It's because he hates you.' I tell her.
'He does not hate me, it's just that he prefers men to women.'
'I do know that, but whether he is homosexual or not, he still hates you.'
She stamps her foot. 'He does not! Besides what would a dirty disgusting looking man like you know about it.'
Toby springs to my defence.
'He wasn't always like that you know.'
'I know what he was. And he was no better then I can assure you.'
'Ah Pasha my precious, even your insults taste like honey.'
'Shut up, and don't you dare call me your precious, it makes me feel sick to hear you talk like that.'
I can see I have made her angry again. I do that so often no matter how hard I try not to. She turns on her heel to face Toby again.
'Now, have you made your mind up? Do you want to do business or not?'
'Err..Not really thank you.'
She walks away from him  and leans back on the wall.
'Go on treat yourself.' I tell him. 'After all it's your birthday.'
'Leave him alone.' Pasha says. ' If he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to. What do I care if I get beaten again.'
'Beaten?' Toby asks her.
'Yes beaten. Surely you've heard of girls that get beaten by their pimps.'
'Well, yes, but I couldn't know that it happened to you.'
'Well I can assure you it does.'
'I can vouch for that.' I say. 'So many times I've seen that beautiful body bruised and burned.'
'Burned?' Asks Toby.
'Yes burned.' she says. 'He stubs out his cigar butts on me. Is that want you want to hear?'
'No, no. I don't want to hear that.'
'But you don't want to  do business either?'
'This is blackmail' He says.
'How can it be blackmail?' She asks him. 'You pay the money, you get my body.'
'But if I don't do it you get burned.'
'Well I can't help that. I don't burn myself'
There is a moment's silence, I can sense Toby weakening.
'Does he really burn you?'
'Of course, here, put your hand on the inside of my thigh, you can feel the marks.'
She moves toward him, takes his hand and places it on her inner thigh.
'You see?' She says huskily. 'You see what that awful man does to me?'

Claude's father and I were at a loss. Our chances of buying the freehold from Claude and the police chief would be almost impossible. We both sat on the grass in my garden and pondered on what our next move should be. Claude's hand had definitely been dipping into the till but who could blame him, his father had paid him a pitiable wage. Claude's father still owned the freehold to the cafe, but the rest of the piazza now seemed unobtainable. It looked like all our fine ideas and careful planning had gone up in smoke. This left me with a particular dilemma as I had already sold my business. For the first time in my life I was without employment. I wasn't short of money of course and my villa was owned outright but I wouldn't have enough to see me through my twilight years in the style to which I had become accustomed. Something had to be done. I knew, of course, that this situation represented some sort of crossroads in my life but I did not at that time realise quite how much my life would change. Looking back, I find that I did not fully appreciate how lucky I had been up until that point. I'd had a splendid childhood and during my teenage years I had everything a young man could desire. A fast car, (For then!) my own apartment, a steady income and plenty of free time, I must have been the envy of many young men at that time. 
I had known Claude's father since we were at school, I was three years above him and one day I was bullying him in the playground. I stood with my hands on my hips surrounded by my pals and was laughing at him trying to snatch his cap back from me. I threw it into the air and he leapt to catch it. Once it was safely in his hands a smile beamed across his face, then he jumped at me and caught me with a very firm right hook. I reeled back and landed in the arms of one of my laughing pals. I was about to retaliate and I expected him to run for his life. After all, I was three years older than him and several inches taller; but he stood his ground. A smile was still on his face as he said: 'If you ever touch me again I shall give you such a thrashing that you won't stand up for a week.' Still rubbing my chin and feeling it beginning to swell, I believed him. He then offered his hand, I hesitated for a moment but then shook it and we have been friends ever since. And here is something else. He is as tough now as he was then.
He was a little like me, from a family not badly off and 
living on the right side of town. I suppose we didn't become really close friends until we had both left school. He would have been fourteen then and I was seventeen. A world war was in progress but it didn't affect our little island very much. Our nation remained neutral so it almost passed us by unnoticed. Many of my contemporaries were anxious to escape to the mainland once the hostilities were over but I had always loved this island and had no wish to leave. 
My father was a shrewd businessman, which he would have needed to be to make money in such a poor country, but he enjoyed his leisure time too. We are not a people that likes to work all the time. He fished, he sailed, he drank, he danced and laughed. Our villa was filled with his laughter.
He taught me many things but I think the most important thing he taught me was how to enjoy life, however with the collapse of our piazza plans I could see my enjoyable life diminishing rapidly. It may have been possible to persuade Claude to deal with us, even though we had kept him out of our original plans, but the police chief was another matter. He would do anything in his power to make our life difficult so there was no chance that he would resell the piazza to us.
As dusk began to settle we made our way make to town and headed for the cafe. A very sheepish looking Claude served us our beers.
'How was I to know you were planning to buy it?' He said to his father. You never said anything to me.'
'It was to be a surprise.'
'A surprise? What sort of suprise is that? A new tie is a surprise, or a couple of theatre tickets, but to plan a whole new shopping centre with no word to me at all is no surprise. It's deceit!'
'But you've done the same damn thing to me!' his father spluttered.
'It's not the same thing at all. I was not planning to re-develop, I bought it only as an investment.'
'Then sell it to me at a profit.'
Claude went quiet. 'I'm afraid that will not be possible, as I told you earlier, I have a partner to consider.'
'Huh! And what a partner. How could you do such a thing?'
'We've been through all this before father. What I do and with whom I do it is my own affair and nothing to do with you.'
At that point an idea came to me. 'Suppose we gave Claude the money to buy out the Police Chief, then when Claude is the sole proprietor, he can sell to us.'
'Yes! Yes! Yes! That is the answer.' Claude's father leapt from his barstool. 'What do you think Claude? This could be the perfect solution couldn't it? And we could make you a partner along with us.'
Claude did not look convinced. 'It might not be as easy as that. The police chief may not want to sell.'
'Would he not be happy with a quick profit?' I ask
'Probably not, I think he has other plans. Besides, he will probably be curious as to how I came by the money and I don't think it will take him long to work out that it was from you two. After all he is a policeman.'
'O.k. I see your point.' I said Perhaps the idea needs a little fine tuning but I still feel it is a possible answer.'
'Me too.' Claude's father agreed. 'We'll work something out I'm sure. But Claude, you mentioned that he had other plans. Do you know what they are?'
'Oh yes, we discussed them in detail.'
'Well, what are they?' I asked after a moment's silence.
Claude shrugged. 'You know, it was..Well..confidential.'
His father slammed a fist down onto the bar. 'You are my son for God's sake! How can your confidence exclude me?'
Claude hung his head. 'He was quite adamant that you were the last person I should tell.'
'Oh was he indeed! Well, we shall just have to see about that! Either you can tell me what his plans are or you are fired.'
Claude began untying his apron.
'Where are you going?' His father asked.
'To pack my bags, I've just been fired.'
Ha! So much for my bright ideas!

Toby is definitely beginning to weaken as he strokes Pasha's leg. A faraway look has swept across his face and his breathing has quickened as Pasha guides his hand nearer the top of her thigh.
'I really don't want you to be beaten,' He assures Pasha. 'but it really would be difficult for me to enjoy your services at the moment.'
'And why is that Toby?' She purrs. 'Are you feeling a little shy?'
'Oh no. Nothing like that, it's just that I don't have any cash on me. Only credit cards or travellers cheques. I haven't had time to change any yet.'
She pulls away from him, looking a little disappointed. 'Well, they are no good to me. You must get some cash from somewhere.'
'Is there a bank open?' He asks me.
'I'm afraid not Toby. Not until the morning'
'Where else can I change my travellers cheques?'
'Nowhere,' I tell him. 'until the banks open.'
'What about the hotels?'
'They are not allowed to change money - they have no permit you see. Nobody has a permit but the banks.'
He turns to Pasha again. "There doesn't seem to be much I can do I'm afraid. Perhaps tomorrow?'
'Oh yes tomorrow will be fine!  I should be in a nice state for you after I have been beaten and burned tonight.'
Toby is wringing his hands. 'Oh dear! I don't want to see you beaten but what else can I do?'
'Sell something.' She tells him.
'Sell something?' He asks incredulously'
'Yes! Sell something.' She points to me. 'That old goat buys as well as sells you know.'
'Huh - do you think I bring a pile of junk on vacation with me on the off chance that somebody may want to buy it?'
'How much for the tie?' I ask.
'I beg your pardon?'
'I said how much for the tie? It looks like good quality silk.'
'Yes, it is.' He tells me. 'It was a birthday present from my mother, last year.'
'O.k.' I say. ' I'll give you twenty for it. That's enough for one position.'
'With clothes on.' Pasha chips in.
'With clothes on.' I confirm.
'Just a minute, just a minute! What do you think my mother is going to think if she finds out I've sold my birthday tie in order to satisfy my carnal lustings?'
'How is she going to find out?' Pasha asks.
'Even if she didn't find out, I'd never be able to look her in the eye again.'
'Don't be so foolish.' I tell him. 'How can a tie be more important than a liaison with of the of the most beautiful women whoever walked the Earth.'
'I realise she is very beautiful but I am not prepared to start selling of my worldly goods to have my wicked way with her.'
'Don't worry Toby' Pasha says, flicking her hair over her shoulder. 'I've been beaten before so it will be nothing new.'
'I can't help it!' He wails. 'It's not my fault that you get beaten. I'm just here on vacation. All I want to do is enjoy myself for a couple of weeks.'
She does not look at him. 'That's understandable, I hope my screams tonight will not disturb you and inhibit the enjoyment of your vacation.'
'Look, if it's that bad why don't you tell the police?'
'HA!' Pasha and I say in unison.'

CHPTER FOUR<p>



For just over a month Claude's father and I ran the cafe between us. Claude moved into a small rooming house opposite the site where my shop used to stand and what was now the construction area for The Hotel Splendide. He took a job as a barman in a waterside tavern used mostly by the local fishermen. It was a rough sort of place and, almost as a necessity, Claude became very scruffy. A trait he keeps until this present day. We heard from various informants that he was unhappy in his new position and hankered after returning to his old situation, but Claude was too stubborn to move back and his father was too proud to ask him.
In the cafe, Claude's father took care of the cooking and I looked after the bar. Whichever of us was less busy at the time waited on tables. Strangely enough, we found that business actually improved after Claude's departure and I was working harder than I had ever done. Running antiques business did not compare with rushing about chasing your own tail in a busy restaurant. When we closed at the end of each evening Claude's father and I would collapse into a couple 
of chairs, absolutely exhausted. It was obvious that we would not be able to cope much longer without employing another pair of hands and so we started scouting around for somebody that would be suitable to wait on tables.
Our first applicant was a fairly elderly woman called Marie. She was smart, enthusiastic, hardworking and punctual. Unfortunately, she was also as deaf as a post. It took us a while to understand why everybody was complaining about having the wrong food. Eventually we realised it was because Marie couldn't hear what they were ordering. Sad, but she had to go after only three days. Next we had an amiable young man who had just moved to our island from the mainland. He was full of himself but had plenty of personality and was popular with the diners. He lasted a little longer, nearly two weeks. We had no idea what happened to him, one evening he didn't turn up and nobody ever saw him again - we didn't even get a postcard. Our third attempt was an absolute disaster!  We employed a young couple who had run off together from the mainland and were more or less hiding on our island. They were desperate for work and accommodation. Two was one more than we really needed but Claude's father and myself took pity on them and employed them both. They did not stop arguing from the moment they arrived. She was always accusing him of looking at other women and he was always accusing her of flirting with other men. Not just in their own time you understand, but also whilst they were working. Sometimes the diners were absolutely silent unable to make themselves heard over the shouting. The climax arrived when they began throwing the diners food at each other. They were packed off at once. God knows where they are now. Married probably. Claude's father and I managed on our own again for a while and then something really quite unexpected happened.
On the way back from picking up some vegetables from the wholesalers, Claude's father spotted the police chief's wife walking along the dusty track beside the coast road. He pulled over and called out to her. It was the first time either of us had seen her since before the wedding.
Claude's father told me later that she had been crying and the tears had left tracks along her dusty face. She told him about how unhappy she had been since her marriage to the police chief, and for the first time she admitted that she had only gone along with it to protect her uncle from a jail sentence. She had been walking along the dusty road for no other reason than to be somewhere that the police chief couldn't find her. She was feeling desperately alone and friendless.
She had been forced to give up her dancing job as he felt it did not befit the wife of the police chief. She had also been forbidden to meet her old friends from the hotel in case they led her into bad ways. He told her what clothes she should wear, and the things he didn't like were torn to shreds and left for her to use as cleaning rags. Apparently, he complained about every meal she cooked for him and a brimming dinner plate was often thrown against the wall in disgust if he had taken particular exception to the food she had cooked. It had been the unhappiest three months of her life. She wanted to run away and had thought of taking a boat to the mainland but he had sworn to track her down by every available means if she ever left him. Claude's father told me later that this whole story was related to him through a continuous flood of tears, and that he had been close to weeping himself.
At first she refused a lift from him in case the police chief spotted them together but eventually he managed to persuade her to come back to the cafe for some coffee and to clean up her face a little. She spent the journey hunched like a small child below the windscreen to avoid being seen.
When they arrived back I was surprised to see her of course and could hardly believe she had been brave enough to defy her new husband by sharing our company. She asked how we were managing without Claude and we told her how busy we had been and how much we needed another pair of hands. We all laughed as Claude's father and I related our stories of the less than successful attempt at employing anybody so far.
She stayed for a little something to eat and by the time dusk began to settle and it was time to open up the cafe, she was looking much happier.
Almost as soon as we opened the door a flood of customers began arriving and Claude's father and myself were suddenly going at it full steam. We never asked her to help, it was just that she was there, and we were busy, and I suppose it seemed like a natural thing for her to do. What a success that evening was. What a team we made! We were laughing and joking through the entire evening and the diners were joining in with our good humour. Claude's father cooked, I served the drinks and took the food orders, and she served the meals and cleaned the tables. One large party of eleven diners had bought a guitar with them and when they had finished eating they sang some of our traditional songs. All of the diners in the cafe joined in with the singing, and can you believe this? The police chief's wife was dancing on the table!

Toby takes off his tie and brings it over to my stall. 'I have an idea.' He says 'If you could possibly lend me the twenty until tomorrow morning, I could leave my tie with you as collateral.'
'Not possible.' I tell him. 'To lend money without a permit is prohibited. If I were caught I could be imprisoned.'
'How would anyone know?'
'You would be surprised what people here know.'
'It was just an idea.' He sighs.
'But I have a better one.' I look around as if it almost something secretive that I am about to tell him. ' You sell me the tie for twenty and tomorrow morning, when you have cashed your travellers cheque, you can buy it back from me at the same price.'
'Is that allowed?'
'But of course. I have a permit to buy and sell.' I point out the permit to him, which is pinned on one of the wooden canopy supports.
'You will look after it won't you?'
'Of course,' I assure him. 'I will guard it with my life.'
He still looks a little apprehensive. 'O.k. Twenty?'
'Yes, twenty.' I take the tie and give him the note. He turns and passes it to Pasha. 'Twenty?'
'Yes, twenty.' she says, tucking the note into her stocking top. 'That's one position with clothes on. Now, where would you like to go? Back to your hotel?'
'Good God no! They might guess. Can't we go to your place.' He asks.
'Certainly not. I would definitely get beaten if I took clients back there.'
'Where then?' 
Pasha looks around her. 'What's wrong with right here?'
'Here?' Toby says in amazement. 'In the street?'
'Why not? We have the wall to lean against.'
It's so...so.. Well, so public.'
She leans forward and exaggeratedly looks up and down the piazza. 'I see no public. What about you, pig? 'She calls out to me. 'Do you see any public?'
I also look up and down the piazza before confirming that I can also see no public.
'No, no, no, no, no.' Toby defiantly folds his arms across his chest. 'This is just not on. Cavorting with a lady of the night is one thing, but not on the street. No, no, no.'
'O.K.' Pasha says. 'Take back your twenty.'
'You can keep it. I don't want to see you beaten.'
'Take it back.' She insists.' You don't want my body, I don't want your money, here take it!'
'Please Pasha, keep it otherwise you'll be beaten.'
'I would rather be beaten than take money that I haven't earned.'
'But I can't have sex with you in the street.' Toby pleads
'And I can't take money I have not earned. I may be a whore but I'm not a thief.'
Then she pushes the money into his top pocket. He removes it and presses it into her hand. She throws it to the floor and kicks it at him. He picks it up, brushes the dust from it and tries to push it into her cleavage. She slaps his face, pulls out the note, screws it into a ball and throws it at his head. He throws it back......... Dusk is beginning to fall, the temperature has dropped a little but it is still warm and they are both getting hot and bothered during this charade. I hold up my arm and say 'Just one moment.' They stop and turn to look at me. 'I think I have an idea.' I tell them.
Ha! I'm a great idea's man!


<p><center> *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  </center><p>

'I have an idea,' I tell Claude's father and the police chief's wife. 'why don't we make this a permanent arrangement?' It was about 1 a.m. and we were each sitting and enjoying a well-deserved drink after clearing the cafe.
'That is a terrific idea' Said Claude's father. 'Oh what a difference you have made this evening my dear.'
She was massaging her toes and giggled as she answered. 'I have had such fun! That is the first time I have danced since my wedding. And this is not like working at all, everybody is so sweet, it is just like having friends in your own home.'
'Then why not work for us on a more regular basis?' Asked Claudes father. The smile disappeared from her face and she gently shrugged her shoulders.
'You know that would not be possible. I will probably be in trouble already for being out so late tonight. He would never let me work here all the time.' 
Claude's father began to relate to me all the things she had told him about earlier that day.
'That bastard!' Claude's father shouted as he stamped to his feet. 'Does he feel he can rule everybody's life?'
'Calm down.' I tell him. 'There is little we can do about the police chief.'
'One day I shall put him to rights.' He went on. 'How I wish now that there had been bullets in that gun. That should have been the end of him then. I swear if I ever get another chance the bullet will go clean through his skull.'
'Shhhh' I try to quiet him but it is too late.
'What are you talking about.' She asks.
'Nothing, nothing.' I say. 'He is just joking.'
'Joking? Joking? I tell you I have never been more serious.'
'What are you talking about?' She asks again. 'Did you try to shoot my husband?'
'No.' I tell her. 'It was a prank. We were drunk'
'Drunk, yes.' He says. 'But it was no prank. And if I had a gun and he were here now I'd do it again without a seconds thought.'
She leaps from her chair her face very serious. She looks at us each in turn. 'Do you mean to tell me that you have already tried to shoot my husband and given the chance you intend to do it again.'
'What he means to say...' I begin, but Claude's father cuts me short.
'YES! That is precisely the situation.' There was a momentary silence, then she clapped her hands together like a little girl and swung us both round in turn with a dizzying dance, laughing uncontrollably as she did it. Maybe it's because I am from a small island, but I have never seen anybody so pleased at the suggestion that her husband was almost murdered.
We told her exactly what had happened on the eve of her wedding, even the bit about Claude almost having his brains blown away. She found the tale hilarious. It must have made us look very inept but for some reason this story must have given her some sense of security, because before she left that evening she had agreed to work for us as a waitress.
She wasn't going to tell the police chief where she was working, although how she ever expected to keep it secret was beyond me. Nothing could ever be kept secret for very long in our community. 
'We have to devise a way to keep it from him.' Said Claude's father. 'If we all put our heads together we should come up with something. Let's have another drink, that should help.'
He took our glasses to re-fill. 'What time does he come off duty my dear?'
'Well, he never really finishes officially but he will normally leave the police station at about 9pm; but then of course he is out drinking with his cronies and hangers on until about 1am. He is never home before then, and often much later.'
'And what does he expect you to do during this time?' I ask. 'After all, if you can't work and you are not to keep in touch with your old friends that doesn't leave much else.'
'Precisely! I am like a prisoner in my own home, but I'm not going to stand for it any longer.'
'Good for you.' Says Claude's father, passing us our fresh drinks. 'Do you know I think I have found a way to carry this off.'
The two of us look toward Claude's father expectantly.
'We will need the help of your mother and sister, but knowing them as I do, I'm sure they will not object.'
'Not at all.' She smiled. 'They would do anything to see me happy again.'
'Then this is the plan.' He continued. 'You will tell your husband that your mother is in ill health, Your sister is prepared to look after her during the day and you feel that you should do your bit by attending to her in the evening. Surely he can't object to you nursing your sick mother?'
'Just a minute.' I say. 'Somebody is bound to notice her working here. You know how some people like to keep in with the police chief. It wouldn't be very long before he was informed.'
Aha! My friend. Do you imagine I have not thought this through thoroughly?' I couldn't help remembering that this was the man who on an assassination mission had lost the gun twice, forgot to load it with bullets, then shot at his own son instead of the target!
'Disguise! That is the answer. We will disguise her. What do you think my dear? Will we get away with it?
She had such a beautiful laugh. 'And what will you disguise me as? An old peasant woman perhaps?'
'No, far more ingenious than that; we will disguise you as a boy.'
I joined in with her laughter, nobody could have looked less like a boy!
'Quiet! Quiet!' Said Claude's father. 'I am serious. We will bunch her hair up under a cap and stick on a phoney moustache, it will work, I know it will.'
Through her laughter she said 'Yes, yes, I'm sure it will, let's try it.'
And so we did. We dressed her in an old shirt and waistcoat of Claude's, tied up her hair and stuck it under a cap, and then we made her a moustache from some black felt. As you can imagine, it looked ridiculous. But what a glorious time we had doing it, and it did give us an idea of how it might work. So it was decided, from the following night she would be our "waiter". We then offered to take her home but she wouldn't hear of it saying that it would not be a good idea if her husband saw her with us now. She dressed back into her own clothes and as she left she made us promise that we would never, never try to shoot her husband again. But I think she was more worried about our safety than his!

'Now, Toby.' I said. 'You don't want to take the money back but at he same time you do not wish to have sex with her in the open air. Am I right?'
'Yes, that about sums it up I suppose.'
'Then why not have her as your dinner guest? - You understand? A paid escort. Claude accepts credit cards so you will still be able to eat there.'
'Brilliant!' He beams. 'What a superb idea.' He turns to Pasha. 'Would that be alright with you.'
'But of course.' She says. 'I get paid, I don't get beaten, and I also get to eat in Claude's restaurant. That suits me fine.'
'Wonderful, wonderful.' He says shaking my hand. 'Thank you so much.'
'My pleasure.'
He peers through the cafe window once more and mentions to Pasha that Rula no longer works there.
'Rula has been sacked?' She asks me.
'No,' I tell her. 'She quit. She could stand Claude no longer.'
'It is more likely she could not stand your disgusting smell anymore.'
I shrug non-comitally. 'Perhaps you're right.'
'Why don't you clean yourself up a bit. You are a disgrace to the piazza.'
For the life of me I couldn't imagine how anyone could be a disgrace to this piazza.
'Perhaps Claude will let me work part time for him now Rula has gone.'
'You know that he wouldn't do that.' I tell her. 'He would rather close down than have you working there. The man is a fool.'
'He is not a fool.' she snarls at me. 'It is you who is the fool.'
'Ha!'
'You would starve if it were not for Claude.'
'So everyone keeps telling me, but if it were not for Claude I would be a long way from starving.'
She pushes a hapless Toby aside as she stomps over to my stall to wag a finger in my face. 'Don't blame him for your misfortunes, you brought them on yourself.'
I can argue against her ideas but not against her beauty. I look into her eyes and find I am unable to form a convincing answer to her accusations.
'Claude does nothing but good for people. And what do you do old man? You sit there complaining about him and running him down and calling his restaurant terrible but at least he has a restaurant. What do you have?' She picks up an old pot from my stall and dashes it against the wall. It breaks into several pieces. 'Nothing, that is what you have. A collection of junk that most people wouldn't take away if you paid them. And you have the cheek to try and sell it! You should be ashamed of yourself. Claude is a good man; you on the other hand should be hounded from the piazza.'
'You see Toby.' I tell him. 'Even her insults taste like honey to me. Is she not the most exquisite creature you have ever seen?'
'She is very nice, yes.'
Pasha sighs heavily takes Toby's arm and leads him to the Cafe.
'Come on Toby, let's eat.'
'We can't, not yet. I was trying to tell you just now, Claude isn't open yet.'
She almost pushed him into one of the cafe chairs. 'Then we will sit here and wait until he is. I don't want to be near that miserable old man a moment longer.'
The metal chairs scrape on the flagstones as they sit and begin their wait. All is quiet for a while. Pasha takes a compact from her handbag and applies a little make up to her face. Toby inspects his nails. I close my eyes and let my head drop to my chest. After a little more of this silence Toby obviously thinks he must make a stab at conversation. What he gains in fortitude he loses in tact.
'Have you always been a hooker?' He asks.

Everything had been prepared quite carefully for the police chief's wife on the following evening. We had found a cap the right size and a moustache that was most convincing. She had made it herself from her own hair. She sat before a long mirror in the cafe and stuck it neatly into place with a little spirit gum. She had also made some sideburns, which were just as convincing. During the day she had been busy at her mothers sewing machine and between them they had made some trousers, a waistcoat and a rough shirt. She completed the outfit with a wide leather belt and a red kerchief around her neck. When the transformation was complete she looked as much like a lad as she was able to. We would just have to hope people didn't look too closely at her.
One more thing, before the cafe opened we had to think of a new name for her. After a little deliberation we decided on Mauricio. She was happy with that as it was the name of one of her favourite uncles and would be easy for her to remember.
And so we opened for business and enjoyed another very successful evening. Have you ever had one of those moments in your life when everything seemed to be just right? Maybe it isn't; but it feels like it, and that is good enough. That is how I felt then. We still had problems of course, Claude's father and I, it still seemed impossible that we would be able to purchase the piazza freehold, but somehow those problems had taken a back seat for a while. All three of us were happy. We were making plenty of money and this gave the police chief's wife a little independence from her husband. My own hunch was that she would save every penny until she had a big enough cache to escape him altogether. We had nearly a six weeks of this sheer happiness but we knew sooner or later it would come to an end. One problem we would have to face would be the situation with the sick mother. It would not take the police chief long to realise that pretty soon she would either be getting much better or much worse. He had been told that she was suffering from a very bad bout of 'flu which had led to a mild attack of pneumonia. We didn't think this through very carefully, it would have been better to give her chronic arthritis. That had more staying power.
By the sixth week he had begun to ask his wife searching questions about her mother's condition and even suggested that perhaps it would be better if she were hospitalised and cared for by professionals. He was fobbed of by a few flimsy excuses but obviously the seed of doubt was growing in his mind and we would need to exercise a degree of caution. Luckily for us, he was not a good husband and as he spent so little time at home himself, he was largely unaware of how often his wife was out. As for his wife - she was becoming more daring by the week. What a change in her confidence we both saw from the day when Claude's father had picked her up sobbing on that dusty road.
Not only was she working at the cafe almost every evening but she would often pay us a visit during the lunchtime session. It was a kind of haven for her I think, somewhere she felt safe from her husband's bullying. As time went on she began to bring one or two of her old friends from the hotel with her. They would lunch together over a few glasses of wine and share the local gossip, a very innocent sort of outing that had been denied her since the wedding. We never asked her to work during those daytime sessions, that was time she could have to herself. It wasn't so busy at these times as it was in the evening so Claude's father and I could manage quite easily on our own.
Every once in a while Claude's father and I would say to ourselves something along the lines of 'Now what's to be done about this piazza freehold?' But nothing was ever decided one way or the other, not until the plans came back from the architects that is! In the excitement of learning that Claude now owned, or rather partly owned, the piazza we had completely forgotten that we had arranged for the architect to do this for us. They arrived in a long cardboard tube and were beautifully produced but much to our disappointment a huge bill accompanied them. It had to be paid of course. It wasn't the architect's fault that we were now unable to proceed with the purchase, it was our fault for not investigating the situation first. Claude's father and I, as previously agreed, stumped up half the money each, which meant we had worked the last six weeks for absolutely nothing. In fact, what we had earned in the last six weeks would not even half cover the bill. This was our first experience of dipping into the kitty but it would be nothing like the last. We sent off the cheque with a sigh and over next day or two we would often open up the useless plans and think wistfully of what might have been.

I thought for moment that Toby might get his face slapped. Pasha is, obviously, quite aware that she is a hooker, or a whore, a prostitute, or a lady of the night. She just doesn't like to have it pointed out. She glared at Toby and he must have realised that he had been a little indiscreet and guided the conversation in a different direction. When they'd first sat down I could tell that Pasha felt hostile toward Toby, as she did the great majority of her clients. You see, I've been sitting here for a good many years now watching Pasha perform her routine for the men. It is a nauseating sight to watch somebody day after day, year in year out selling not only their body but their very soul as well. I realised that Pasha was warming to Toby when she actually made conversation with him, and not simply  answering him with a simple yes or no. I can hear them both quite clearly from where I sit, my eyesight has faded but my hearing is still keen.
She has asked him if he would like to dance. Toby looks surprised and she tells him Claude has an old jukebox.
Poor Toby protests that he has two left feet and would be hopeless. She laughs at him and tells him anybody can dance if they try hard enough but he insists he must be the exception. He tells her an anecdote about an elderly aunt who, after a waltz with him at a family wedding, swore she would never dance with him again as it made her feel seasick. Pasha laughs a lot at this. It is such a joy to see her happy even if it is momentary.
Pasha stands up, takes Toby's hand and makes him rise too. She tells him that she will teach him to dance. He is still protesting but eventually he gives in but then realises almost immediately that he has no money to play the jukebox. She puts a finger to her lip as if to swear him to secrecy, she then explains that kicking it firmly at a certain spot will make it play for free. He takes off his jacket, hangs it on the back of the chair, then they disappear giggling into the cafe. In a moment or two I hear the strains of a once popular song drifting through the door. I am trying to remember when I first heard it and as I gently probe the deep dark recesses of my mind I can feel a luxurious drowsiness descending on me. It is now almost dark but still comfortably warm, my breathing becomes slower and softer as I begin to sink in that abyss of sleep. There is only the sound of chirping crickets and the soft strains of the now forgotten tune. My head drops to my chest once or twice as sleep takes over completely. I give in, lay my arms on the table and cross them to support my grey old head. I can feel peace, and hope that this is how I shall feel when I die. But just as my mind closes there is a deafening crack. My heart misses a beat as I become bolt upright, my eyes begin to focus on the truncheon which had smashed onto the table, then I looked up into the grinning face of the police chief.

Three or four days after we had received the plans from our architect, Claude's father decided to pay a visit to Claude. It was hoped we might be able to make him see sense, Although that was not one of Claude's strong points. I expected him to get back to the cafe at about 4.30. but at 6 there was still no sign of him. This was unusual as he was normally a most punctual man. I put it down to the possibility that Claude and his father had locked horns and neither was going to give in.
I was putting out the tablecloths as, at last, I heard him approach. He shouted out for me almost as soon as the car stopped. I went to the window to see what all the excitement was about.
'Hey! Come out here.' He yelled. 'Come and see what I've got.'
'I have to get the tables ready.' I yelled back.
'Never mind that now, we have two hours till we open, come and give me a lift with this.'
I left the stack of tablecloths on the bar and went out to his car.
'Look! Look!' He beamed. 'Look what we have here. We are now in the twentieth century my friend.'
I looked into the back of the shootingbrake as he raised the tailgate and laying there on it's back, almost like an invalid, was the juke box. It was huge.'
'Will we lift it with just the two of us.' I asked
'It only took two to put it in.'
'Did you get this from Claude then'
'Claude! Pah! I swear I shall never speak to that boy again.'
'He is your only son for God's sake. How can you never talk to him again?'
'I have run out of patience with him! He still refuses to come to his senses and join us. Can you honestly believe it? Of all the people on this island he could have gone into business with, he has to choose the police chief!
'And I gather you are no closer to discovering what their future plans are for the piazza.' I asked
'No.' He snorted. 'For that we will have to wait and see.'
'So where did this come from then.' I jerked a thumb at the jukebox. His face lit up again.
'This.' He said with a huge grin. 'Was a gift from my good friend Joaquim. He has no further use for it so has passed it on to us. Isn't it a magnificent machine?'
Joaquim owned a small cafe, which stood next door to my old antique shop. Like me, he had been offered a very good price for his property in order that it could be knocked down to make way for The Hotel Continentale. Claude's father had called in there for a beer after his fracas with Claude, to find Joaquim packing away the contents of the cafe prior to moving out. At this time Joachim must have been just over sixty and he planned to retire on the proceeds of the sale. As Claude's father enjoyed one of the last beers to be served in the bar he dug into his pocket for a coin to play the jukebox. 'So, here is to your new life of idle retirement Joaquim.' He toasted. 'Now how about one more tune from the juke box to play you out.'
As Claude's father was about to push the coin into the slot, Joaquim playfully pushed him aside.
'Keep your money in your pocket, I will show you how to play this juke box.' He gave it a substantial kick at the base and the machine whirred into life and began to play Que sera sera. 'You see my friend,' Said Joaquim to Claude's father. 'that's the way to treat machines.'
They had a couple more beers together and toasted the soon to built Hotel Splendide, then they played chequers until it was time for Claude's father to take his leave. 'I shall miss you Joaquim,' He said, shaking his hand warmly. And I shall miss this miserable cafe of yours and your infernal juke box.'
Joaquim laughed with a chesty rattle. 'The cafe will soon be flattened but I think you should take the juke box with you, then you can kick it yourself as often as you like.'
'Well, now you mention it, how about me taking it of your hands for a paltry twenty five.'
'I don't need your money, it would break my heart to take it as I know how much you hate to part with it. Take it, it's yours, and I will be glad to see the back of it.'
And so between them they loaded it into the back of the shootingbrake.
We slid it out of the vehicle slowly and carefully. It was a monster and very heavy, we had no wheels or trolley of any kind so it was a long-winded affair to move it a few centimetres at a time  across the square, through the door and across the length of the cafe until it was finally in place. Claude's father fetched a can of spray polish and a yellow cloth and buffed it to a high sheen. We plugged it in and it burst into a flicking, neon brightness which lit the room far more effectively than the lights fitted to the cafe.
I was about to insert a coin into the slot when Caude's father stopped me and showed me the trick. I don't think a single coin was ever fed into that machine, not until Claude moved back that is.

'Not dead yet then.' Says the police chief with that sickly grin still planted on his face.
'I'm still a long way from dead.' I tell him
'I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.' He slaps the truncheon into his palm as he speaks. Perhaps this is meant to intimidate me but it doesn't. 'It has come to my attention that there has been an unsavoury character hanging around the morgue. I thought perhaps you might be able to help with my enquiries.'
'Me?' I shrug. 'Why would you think that I know anything?'
'Because as soon as unsavoury character was mentioned, you came to mind.'
'I go nowhere near the morgue. Why should I? As you rightly observe, I'm not dead yet.'
'I can't believe that at your advanced years you are too naive to know that there are certain disgusting, immoral, sick people that gain sexual pleasure from intercourse with corpses!'
I look at him as if this is news to me.
'Every  time I think of it my stomach turns, but the culprit shall be caught and punished.'
'Quite rightly.' I agree. He lights a small cigarillo and throws the dead match onto my table.
'It makes me want to retch! - It is an offence you know.'
'To retch?' I enquire.
The truncheon crashes down once more and his face is so close to mine that I can smell the foul stench of his cigarillo soaked breath as he yells at me. 'To have sexual intercourse with a corpse!' He stares silently at me for a moment or two, presumably to let his words of wisdom soak into my old brain, then moves toward the cafe.
'Why isn't Claude open yet?'
'His chef quit this morning which has left him in somewhat of a panic.'
The police chief passes by this way on most days and Claude will serve him coffee. It would be an inconvenience to him to find the cafe closed. Ha! 
He notices Toby's jacket and lifts it from the chair back with his truncheon. 'Who does this belong to?'
'One of pasha's clients.'
'That is good to hear - that she has a client. Where are they?
'In the cafe. She is showing him the jukebox.'
'What an odd way to do business, still that's her concern.' He inspects the jacket carefully before replacing it on the chair. 'Tell pasha's client, when he returns, that he should not be so careless with his property. The next thing we know, he will be reporting it stolen and I shall have to waste my precious time searching for it. My job is to prevent crime as well as solve it you understand.'
I nod as he moves back to my table. He looks depreciatingly at the goods that are displayed on it and picks up Toby's tie. 'How much is this?'
'Its....ah....not for sale.'
He addresses an imaginary audience 'Correct me if I'm wrong, I pick this item up from a junk stall, the item is junk and yet it is not for sale. How curious!'
'I am looking after it for him.' I add
'But his jacket is left on the chair, why did he not leave the tie in the same place?'
'How am I to know?'
'Sometimes you know too much old man, it will be the death of you.'
'Knowing too much won't be the death of me, but knowing too little might.' He ignores this and throws a note onto the table. 'Here, take this for the tie.'
'I told you, I can't sell you the tie.'
'The only reason you wouldn't be able to sell the tie is if you had loaned money against it, which, as you know only too well, is an imprison-able offence. Is that the case?'
I hesitate for a moment then pick up the note with a shrug. 'Take the tie, take it and let me be' 
He swaggers from the piazza. 'Tell Claude I will be back later for my coffee.'
'I'll tell him, have a nice day police chief.' And more quietly I add a special farewell, which I reserve solely for him. 'And may your arse fester!'

All our clients were thrilled with the jukebox. As far as we knew it was the only one on the island, nobody was more pleased with it than our "Mauricio" though. Claude showed her, and most of our diners, how to make it work for free.
'What are you doing?' I jokingly scolded him. 'We are supposed to be making money from that thing, not giving the tunes away. Then one of our regulars stood up from his meal. 'Pardon me sir,' He said through a mouthful of bread. 'I have sung here at least three times a week for the last month but nobody gives coins to me.'
Claude's father smiled and threw him a coin. 'Here, take this.'
The coin was skilfully caught. 'Why thank you sir, tonight I shall sing a song of your choosing.'
'You misunderstand my friend, that coin was to stop you singing tonight.' The diner sat down again amid the clapping and howls of laughter from the other diners.
So, you see, we made a very successful business of the cafe between the three of us. It was probably as busy at this time as it had ever been. Our reputation began to spread and although he would probably be the last to admit it, Claude's father was actually a very good cook.

As a young lad I had caught the fishing bug from my father and when we were teenagers Claude's father and I would often spend two or three days camping out by the lake. Ha! We called it a lake but in all honesty it is really no more than a pond. Claude's father would always cook on these camping trips and what a job he would make of it. He seemed to use no more than the fish and a pan, perhaps a little seasoning, but it would taste absolutely delicious every time.
On one particular occasion we had been a little careless preparing the cooking stove. Some methylated spirit had spilt on the dry grass, it didn't take much to ignite it and before we knew it we had a potentially dangerous fire on our hands. It later years, open fires were banned as so much damage had been caused by careless tourists lighting them for picnics, but this was a long time before the tourists arrived. Claude's father and I slapped at the flames with shirts we had soaked in the pond, it must have taken us a good fifteen minutes to get it under control. As the last of the flames were extinguished we collapsed blackened and exhausted onto the grass, but just as we lay back we became aware of a rushing through the long grass behind us. We looked around and saw two young, beautiful girls running towards us. They began shouting as we looked up.
'You idiots! What on earth do you think you are playing at? Don't you know how dangerous it is to light fires at this time of year? You should be locked up, both of you.'
We laughed at them, but remember we were two teenage boys. What else could we do? They became really angry then and eventually they made us apologise, for causing the fire and for laughing at them. So we both announced profusely sorry we were and then invited them to join us for lunch. We recognised them of course, after all, this is a very small island, they had been a year or two below us at school. The taller one, Marie, now worked in a ladies wear shop in town. The other, Ignacia, I was almost certain had secured a place at the university on the mainland. It would, at this time, have been the summer recess and she would be home on vacation. They looked coyly at each other and then decided, yes, they would join us for lunch. Claude's father and I made such a fuss of them. Of course when we were camping we lived very rough, but we did try to make them things as comfortable as we could for them. We ate the freshly caught fish along with great chunks of home made bread, big juicy tomatoes and some cold potato's that we had brought with us. They contributed some sticky buns and a bottle of ginger ale. What a feast! They stayed with us until sunset but then had to make their way home, but not before we had made them promise to se us again. It was arranged that we would meet up again on Wednesday of the following week. We planned to take a picnic supper down to the beach and if we met at about 5pm there would be time for a swim first. During the course of the afternoon and evening it became obvious that Marie was loosely paired with Claude's father and Ignacia with me. That suited me fine. I remember that as she sat close to me while we ate, her arm simply brushed against mine but it lit up something within me. I became like a simpleton when I tried to talk to her. I would stumble and stutter over the simplest sentences and my heart would leap each time she smiled at me. And remember, this was even before our first date. I discovered I was right about her being at university, she was studying to be a teacher.
'So I presume you will leave our little island when you are qualified?' I asked
'Do you think the island does not need teachers then?' She teased.' 
She'd embarrassed me. 'No, of course not, I just assumed....'
'One should never assume, it could lead to all sorts of complications. I love this island and would hate to leave it permanently; I hope very much that I shall be able to teach here.'
'I don't want to leave either.' I told here. ' I'm sure I am as happy here as I would be anywhere.'
Yes, that's what I told her. And at the time I really meant it.
We did all meet up again at the beach and what a glorious time we had. Can you imagine the thrill of seeing those two wonderful girls in their swimwear! Of course we were far more prudent in those days, no such things as bikinis. What those two girls wore on the beach was probably more than most girls wear on the street these days. But to Claude's father and I it was a very big thrill.
They had prepared the picnic this time and what a feast it was, and when we had eaten our fill we lay back on the cool sand and watched the glittering lights of the distant coast. That was when we had our first kiss, Ignacia and I, It was long and deep and powerful. We held each other like we would never let go. Her legs entwined about mine as we dug our toes into the sand to push ourselves closer than we could have thought possible. She clenched a knot of my straggly dark hair and twisted my face toward her mouth for us to kiss again and again. And what about this - we hadn't had a sip of alcohol!
For the next few weeks we were almost constant companions. We would meet up every night when I had finished work. We would swim, or fish and sometimes we would spend the evening drinking beer with Claude's father and Marie in the cafe that was run at that time by Claude's grandfather. I was invited to meet her parents and she met mine, we were just as all young couples might have been. 
One night I noticed a tear in Ignacia's eye as I walked her home from the cafe.
'Why are you crying?' I asked her quietly. 'Have I upset you.'
'Of course you have upset me you brute.' Her tears turned to a half smile and she linked her arms around my neck. 'How am I to go back to university now you have made me feel like this?'
Of course! In September I would lose her again. It would only be for a few months but those few months would be unbearable. I couldn't bear to be the reason for her breaking her studies though.
'I love you, and I don't want you to go back, but you must! I would never be able to live with myself if you gave up your studies for me.'
She gripped me tighter and began to sob. I could barely make out what she was saying through her tears but I knew she didn't want to go. For the next few days it was all we talked about. I couldn't be with her because I had to help my father run his business and she couldn't be with me because if she gave up her studies she would not be able to teach, there would also be a lot of trouble with her parents. They had given up so much in order to send her to university they would not be at all pleased if she threw it all away now.
The only thing that would keep us sane was to make the most elaborate plans for our future. Firstly we decided to get engaged, and the week before she returned to her studies we had an enormous party. The whole island must have been there. What a celebration! There was singing and dancing and coloured lights, wine flowing like water and the entire evening we spent in each others arms. And what a fuss Ignacia made of her new engagement ring! How it sparkled on her finger as she showed it off to all of her friends. It had cost me a good deal of money but that bothered me not in the slightest. If only I could show you the happiness it brought her on that night.  Claude's father, who was to be my best man, made a speech but was so drunk that he fell from the rostrum half way through it. He did sober up enough to announce that Marie and he were to be engaged, then he promptly got drunk again.
With only four days left Ignacia and I planned where we should live and how we should furnish our new home. We decided we wanted as many children as God gave us and we spent an entire evening thinking of names for them. And a dog. Yes, we must have a dog, nothing fancy, a rugged old mongrel would do. And a swing in the garden, that was also a certainty. Chickens too! We should definitely have chickens for our fresh eggs. So much planning we did. Our whole lives mapped out and not a single cloud in sight.
We were both in floods of tears the day she left. The ferry horn was sounding its urgency to be away but we could hardly bear to release our grip on each other. She waved from the starboard rail and I leaned from the jetty till I almost tipped into the ocean. I almost jumped and swam after her. What a foolish notion! She cupped her hands about her mouth as the boat left its white furrows. 'Write every day, don't forget me'
I stood on the jetty until the ferry was completely lost to view then turned sadly with a heavy heart wondering how I was to fill my time now she had left. Can you believe this: I started my first letter to her as soon as I arrived home. She had been gone only a half-hour but already it was agony. Is it possible to have feelings like this as an old man or do they only come to the young?
For the first two weeks I received a letter from her everyday then they became a little less frequent and then,
hardly at all. I always wrote every day. I assumed she was writing less because of her studies taking up so much time. As she had told me herself, to assume can lead to complications!
The final letter I had from her contained not a word of text. I ripped it open in anger knowing what was inside and let the ring drop into my palm. I walked to the sea wall with eyes so misted with tears that I could hardly see my way. I stood unsteadily on the wall and threw the ring for all I was worth into the same ocean in which I was much later to throw the pistol that had belonged to Claude's father.
I heard, in a round about way, some years after this that she had married a lecturer from the university and that they had been blessed with two sons. Ha! only two sons! She never did return to the island she loved so much, she never became a teacher, never had a dog or kept chickens and there was no swing in her garden. Ha! what kind of life is that!

CHAPTER FIVE<p>





I stare for a moment or two at the note the police chief had given me in exchange for Toby's tie and I'm trying to think of a way to explain the situation to him. My thoughts are interrupted by the abrupt end to the music, followed by a loud commotion from the cafe which before long spills out into the piazza. 
Toby is the first through the door. His hands are above his head to protect it from the blows Claude is inflicting with a wooded spatula.
'What do you think you are doing? Kicking my juke box like that..' Each sentence is accompanied by four of five blows with the spatula. 'It's a delicate machine, do you have no respect for other people's property?'
'Ouch! Ouch! I'm sorry, please stop hitting me, I'll pay for any damage. Ouch!....'
Pasha follows Claude out. She is trying to stop him hitting Toby but is carrying her shoes and trying to massage her toes at the same time. She grabs his arm. 'It was my fault Claude, I showed him how to do it.' Claude turns from Toby and glares at Pasha. 'Huh! Yes, I might have known you were at the root of it. What do you think you are doing in my cafe? Keep yourself out on the street where you belong.'
'She is joining Toby at your illustrious restaurant for dinner.' I announce. He traipses over to my barrow and whispers consiprationally to me. 'I don't know why you have any truck with that woman, she is nothing but trouble. She should be hounded from the piazza.'
'It is you who should be hounded from the piazza Claude. You have chosen your own destiny, hers was chosen for her.'
'She is nothing but a slut.' He says, loud enough for her to hear.
Pasha is sitting on one of the cafe chairs inspecting her bruised feet. 'Oh Claude, you only call me that because you wish to hide your true feelings from me.'
'I call you that because that is what you are, and always have been as far as I'm concerned.'
'You see what kind of man he is Pasha?' I say. 'I don't know why you tolerate him.'
'Why does anybody tolerate you?' She snipes back. 'You disgusting, decrepit, old pervert................'
She moves toward me but Claude yanks her away. 'What right have you to call him a pervert? It is you who is perverted.'
'Take your hands from her!' I yell 'Or I'll give you a taste of your own medicine.'
'But I am defending you my friend.'
'It will be a poor day when I need you to defend me Claude.'
Pasha breaks free from Claude's grip. 'Oh! big talk from a man that relies on Claude to feed him.' 
'I rely on nobody' I retort, but not with much conviction.
Claude pushes her away from this time. "What business is it of yours who I feed. At least he earns an honest living.'
'But Claude,' Her eyes plead with him to understand. 'my living is honest too. I don't trick people or steal from them. You know how honest I am.'
'I know nothing of the kind.' He snorts, then goes back into the cafe. Pasha sits back down again and Toby peers at her feet. 'Do they feel alright now?'
'A little tender,' She tells him. 'but I don't think anything is broken.'
'Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.'
She carefully slips her shoes back on, wincing. 'The next time somebody tells me they can't dance, I shall believe them.'
Toby looks very apologetic. 'I did try to tell you.'
I ease my old body from the stool and move toward them executing one or two rusty dance steps as I go. 'You should not attempt to dance with a beautiful woman Toby if you are going to trample all over her feet.'
'I didn't want to dance! - I kept telling her that.'
Pasha stands carefully testing her feet for pain. 'What would you know about it you decrepit old fool.'
'I used to cut quite a dash in my time.' I tell them. 'Claude's father and I were often to be seen on the dance floor, we were much younger then of course.'
'And not so smelly.' Pasha adds.
I try a couple more dance steps but realise that nobody is watching me and then I feel a little ridiculous. Toby and Pasha are both sat at the cafe table again and I hobble back to my stool. For those few moments that I was dancing I had forgotten about Toby's tie. I am about to mention it but catch myself at the last moment and decide to keep quiet  for a while. Maybe he has forgotten about it. If that's the case I shall be off the hook and without having to think of an explanation. I also consider telling Pasha that the Police Chief passed by, but then, once more, I decide to keep quiet about that too.
It is almost dark now, the single street lamp in the piazza is lit and the crickets are chirping more noisily, I can sense that Toby is struggling once again to make conversation.
'What would you like to have been?' He asks Pasha. 'You know, if you weren't a wh.... er, if you didn't do what you do now?'
She smiles at his innocence and considers the question seriously. 'Am I allowed to choose something that I have no qualifications for?' She asks.
'Oh yes, anything at all.'
'O.K. then, I would like to have been a doctor.'
'Really?' He says, wide eyed.
'Yes. But I would only treat poor people. The rich can look after themselves. I would charge only what they could afford. And if they kept chickens, then they could pay me in chickens. If they grew oranges they would pay me with those. If they had nothing, they would pay nothing.'
'Well I think that's a lovely idea.' Toby enthused
A look of deep sadness crossed her face. 'But that's just a dream isn't it? I don't have the brains to be a doctor; I should think myself lucky that I have the body to be a whore.'
'You shouldn't put yourself down like that.' He scolds her. 'You seem very brainy to me. A lot brainier than some of the people I work with I can tell you! You could be almost anything you wanted to I should think.'
'And what do you suppose my pimp would have to say about that? Do you think he would take kindly to me telling him one fine day that I have had enough of whoring and I am now going to be a doctor instead?'
'He might not mind too much'
She snorts in contempt. 'How little you know of such things.'
'Then why don't you run away?' He suggests.
'Do you think that has never crossed my mind? Every day I consider it, but he has sworn that if I ever leave this island he would spend every penny he has to track me down and bring me back.'
'Would he really do that?' Toby asked
'Oh yes, He would do that alright.'


















CHAPTER SIX<p>


Claude's father and Marie married just six months after their first meeting. The rumour around the island was that they had married so quickly because Marie was probably pregnant. There was great substance to the rumour as she was actually pregnant. There was little Claude, forming inside her. I think I was probably the first to know this as Claude's father called at our villa late one evening and beckoned me outside. At the time I was still living with my father and mother. He obviously had something to tell me in private.
'Over here, over here.' I followed him toward the old swing made from a worn tyre.
'It's pretty late you know. What do you want?'
'I am in a fix.'
'What sort of fix?' He shook a couple of cigarettes from a pack and passed one to me. We both smoked in those days. Almost everybody did.
' Give me a light and let me tell you about it.' I passed my box of matches to him and it took him three strikes before his cigarette glowed, his hand shaking tremulously.
'You seem a nervous wreck, what on Earth is wrong?'
' Marie is having a baby, I got her pregnant.'
Nothing was said then for a moment or two.
'So, are you to marry?'
'Yes, yes of course. I love her so very much.'
'Why are you in a fix then?
' We haven't told her parents yet and they are not going to take it well.'
'Yes I can see that might be a bit of a fix.'
It was such a warm calm summers evening, I swung slowly on the tyre and my thoughts involuntarily drifted away from my friends problem for a few selfish moments. What ran through my head was that if only Ignatia had come back to me. If only she could have been a teacher here on the island. If only she had loved me enough I would not have worried a jot about telling her parents that she was pregnant.
'What am I to do?'
'You have to tell them of course. And probably sooner rather than later.'
'Yes. I knew you'd say that and I know you are right.'
'It's probably a bit late tonight but I think you should do it tomorrow.'
'I know that would be the best thing.'
'How is Marie?'
'Well, that's the thing, Marie is overjoyed. She wants to get married as soon as possible of course.'
'Yes, I can understand that.'
'She wants me to tell them.'
'Maybe that's the right thing to do, for you to tell them.'
'It won't be easy.'
'Of course not. They are good people though. And of course you are engaged.'
'That's not the same as being pregnant.'
' That is true but they are expecting you to be together, they will be assuming you will be married at some point.'
'But not expecting to be grandparents this soon.'
'You have to tell them tomorrow.'
There was another short pause before he said slowly.
'Yes, I will. I'll tell them tomorrow.'
He had been sitting crossed legged on the grass and he rose thoughtfully. His hands then sank deep into his pockets as he turned and walked away, head bowed, without another word.
 I heard from him later that the meeting had not gone as badly as he had expected. Pregnancies before marriage were rare on our island at that time and the parents were a little shocked but forgiving. The marriage was arranged for a month later. And I was proud to be his best man. The reception was not at the Hotel Spendide but at his father's little cafe. The guests spilled out into the piazza which was lit with brightly glowing coloured lights. Where my junk stall stand now there was a small stage with some local musicians playing. It was both a low key and at the same time a grand affair. Nobody could mistake how much these two loved each other. I was so very,very happy for them. But I could not help a tear falling from my eye as I thought of how it could have been with Ignatia.
With some help from their parents they managed to buy a small cottage and when they first moved in I helped in the renovation and decorating. It was hard work but worth it as it became a beautiful cottage for them. 
When Claude was born they were both overjoyed, so were the two sets of grandparents. It seemed a match made in heaven as they say.

Pasha and Toby sat down once more at one of the outside cafe tables. Pasha still massaging her feet. I then notice Toby's hand fiddling near his neck. Glancing over to my stall he asked.
'Do you still have my tie?'
' I am sorry Toby, I was forced to sell it.'
'SELL IT! Are you serious, you said you would guard it with your life.'
 ' I am afraid the police chief wanted to buy it and he is a difficult man to refuse.'
Pasha made a snorting sound. ' A very difficult man to refuse.'
'How can I get it back then?'
I look down, a little embarrassed. ' That maybe very difficult'
'Or more likely impossible.' Pasha adds.
'Surely if I explain the situation he will sell it back to me?'
'If you do that he will assume I have lent you money against the tie and that could lead to my imprisonment.'
'Oh surely not. How can you go to prison for wrongfully selling a tie?'
'I need a cigarette.' Pasha says, adding ' You can go to prison for almost anything here.'
'That is true.' I nod. 
'So you mean I am never going to get my tie back?'
'It seems unlikely.' I sigh.
'But on the bright side, you hbave myt company.' Pasha smiled. 'And I won't get beaten.'
Toby is silent but taps his fingers on the table. At that momnet Claude pokes his head through the cafe door
'Will you want starters and a main course?'
Toby turns around to face him. 'I'm not sure, we haven't seen the menu yet.'
There is a long loud sigh from Claude.  'You want a menu?' he asks begrudgingly.
'If it isn't too much trouble.'
'It is a lot of trouble but no matter, I'll get you a menu.'
I shake my head in disbelief at Claude's reply as he disappears back into the cafe. I am feeling guilty about Toby's tie but hope I have heard the last of it. I can't help feeling that the police chef was aware that it would case trouble when he purchased it.
Pasha and Toby sit patiently waiting for Claude to bring the menu. Once again I feel sleep waving over me and my chin begins to drop to my chest.

We were victims of our own success, Claude's father and I. The restaurant had become so popular that everybody wanted to be seen there, including the police chief!
It happened on a particularly busy night, Claude's father was flying around the cooking range and I had just dashed into the kitchen to collect a tray of desserts when "Mauricio" came rushing through, tears brimming in her eyes.
'What's wrong?' I asked putting the tray down again, she came to me and sobbed onto my shoulder as I put my arms about her.
'He's here. My husband is in the restaurant.'
'Don't cry.' I soothed her. 'You can hide in here, I will manage on my own until he leaves.'
Claude's father turned from the range to see what the trouble was. 'Don't worry my dear, we will tell him there are no free tables.'
'No, no, we can't do that.' I said. 'It may make him suspicious, and that is the last thing we need. I can manage.'
She broke into renewed sobs. 'You don't understand, he is not alone.'
'Even better grinned Claude's father. We will definitely tell him there is no room for his party.'
'Think carefully my friend.' I told him. 'We don't want to stir up trouble.'
She put clenched fists to her eyes. 'He is not with a party - he is with another woman!'
Claude's father and I fell silent for a moment, I sat her gently onto one of the kitchen stools as she sobbed her heart out.
'The swine.' Spat Claude's father as he struck the kitchen range with a wooden spatula, it shattered to splinters. 'This time he has gone much to far.' He ripped off his striped apron and headed for the stairs.'
'What are you doing?' I asked in bewilderment.
He looked at me over the balustrade. 'I am going to shoot him, and this time the gun will be loaded.'
'Wait, wait, wait,.' I pulled him back down the stairs. 'Are you mad? There is a restaurant full of people out there, it would be impossible to shoot him in such a crowded place without injuring some innocent person. Besides, you don't have a gun any more, I threw it into the sea.'
'Then I'll damn well strangle him' He said, winding the apron into a cord.
'Please! Sit down....and be calm.' I gently pushed him onto the stool next to the police chief's wife. 'We have to be sensible about this - for everybody's sake. It would be foolish to make trouble.'
The sobs were growing louder, I turned to her, took a handkerchief from my pocket and helped dry her tears. 'It may be innocent, perhaps it is just a female friend he is with.'
'No,' She sobbed. 'I recognise her, I think he had an affair with her before we married.'
'But if that's the case, then why would he bring her here? Surely he wouldn't parade a lover in front of Claude's father and myself. He would know we would soon tell you about it.'
She snatched the handkerchief from me. There was anger in her eyes. 'He would do it because he can do it. He can do whatever he chooses to do because there will be no way that anybody can stop him. He believes himself invincible and beyond reproach. Do you honestly think he would care if I did discover he was having an affair?' 
I hung my head and shrugged. Claude's father also said nothing. She blew her nose and regained some composure. 'You are right, it would be crazy to make trouble. It may even make things difficult for my mother. I will hide in here until he leaves.'
Something Claude's father had been cooking was overheating and splattering onto the range. It sizzled and spat as it hit the hot iron where it burned. He turned slowly, scraped the mess up with the splintered spatula and dropped the sticky, broken mess into a waste bin.
'Yes, yes, you are both right.' He said stirring the pan slowly with a clean spoon. 'Why cause ourselves more trouble, why don't you wait upstairs my dear, you'll be well out of sight there.' He turned to me as she climbed the stairs. 'But as I am not permitted to shoot or strangle him, I beg one indulgence my friend.'
'What is that?' I asked
'I should very much like to spit in his soup.'
We both smiled, which lifted the gloom a little.
'I can see no difficulty with that, and with your permission, I should like to join you.'
I went back through to the restaurant with the desserts I had originally gone to collect, gave them to the diners, then moved to the police chief's table to take his order. I also recognised the woman he was with. I'd never liked her, she was a gossip, a vicious nasty piece of work.
'Ah! it looks like our order is to be taken at last.' He bellowed leaning back on his chair. How tempting it was to flip my foot beneath the leg and have him over, but I resisted.
'I am sorry to keep you waiting, we have been very busy this evening.'
'And every other evening, so I am told. I really must congratulate you on your success. I can't tell you how pleased I am to see you and your friend doing so well.'
'Thank you.' I said without humour. 'Are you ready to order?'
'We'll start with your best bottle of red wine and some grilled sardines.' He spread a napkin prematurely across his lap. 'I should like to point out to you that my visit here is not solely pleasure this evening, I also have a little business matter I should like to discuss with you both.'
The surprise must have shown on my face. 'Business!.....with us? What on earth would you have to  discuss with us?'
'All in good time my friend, all in good time, but first we want feeding. Isn't that right my dear.' He grasped his companion's knee, she didn't answer him but smiled a sickly grin. 'She will have the same.'
I rushed into the kitchen with their order and shook Claude's father violently. 'Listen, listen. He has business he wants to discuss with us - Can you believe that. It can only mean one thing, surely.......'
'Business?.......With us?'
'I know, I know, it doesn't make sense does it. Why should he suddenly want to do business with us!'
Claude's father looked concerned. 'I smell a rat!'
'Now just a minute' I said. 'Don't let's jump to conclusions, let's hear what he has to say first.'
'He's always hated us, and we've always hated him. Why should he want to do business with us unless it was a trap of some kind?'
'He doesn't have to be a friend to do business with us. It is obviously going to be in his own interest to sell us the freehold, I realise he isn't going to do it for love. There has got to be something in it for him but why should that worry us?'
'I still say we should be very careful. He'll probably sell us the piazza then make it illegal to own one!'
'Ok.' I agreed. 'We must be very careful but I still feel we should listen to what he has to say. By the way - two plates of grilled sardines, and he wants a bottle of our best wine, what shall I give him?'
'Give him dog's piss for all I care. A man like that wouldn't know the difference.'
He slid the sardines under the grill as I carved some bread. 'I don't think we should antagonise him too much at this stage.' I said, a little sharply. 'And serving him dog's piss would probably impair the reputation we have managed to acquire up till now.' I finished slicing the bread slammed the knife to the table and fetched a bottle of Dao terras altas.
It was a bit of a struggle on my own that evening but by and large I managed to keep the diners happy. I was trying to get them to leave as soon as possible after they had finished eating as I was anxious to talk business with the police chief but it was gone midnight as the last of them passed through the doors. 
The police chief sat at the table puffing on a fat cigar and swilling a very large brandy as I scurried round clearing the mess from the tables. I heard him laugh out loud at a joke he had told his companion, then he waived me over.
'Leave that for later - bring through your friend and let's talk some business, and perhaps you would be kind enough to call a taxi for my guest.'
'Am I to leave on my own then?' She asked, a little surprised.
'You are indeed my dear, my business ideas are not for your ears. Besides, I'm sure your husband will be pleased to see you home early for a change.' He gave me an exaggerated wink but I pretended not to notice it.
'Yes he will.' She said standing up in a huff. 'Perhaps he will see me home early a lot more often - forget the taxi, I'll walk.'
'As you wish my dear. Thank you for a pleasant evening.'
'Don't mention it.' She said, slamming the door behind her.
'Ah, women!' He grinned. 'They are all the same, don't you think?'
I shrugged. 'Maybe. - I'll fetch Claude's father.' I went through to the kitchen where he was pottering around trying to look like he had something important to do. 'Come on through, he's ready to talk to us.' He said nothing but  wiped his hands, threw down his apron and marched into the restaurant ahead of me. I let out a deep sigh and followed him through. What a curious situation this was, Claude's father, the police chief and I sitting around the cafe table ready to talk business; whilst just above us, in the sitting room, the police chief's wife was hiding from him.
'So,' Said the police chief. 'I hear you have big plans for the piazza.'
Claude's father looked at him suspiciously and waited a moment or two before replying. 'That is correct, although I was unaware it was common knowledge.'
The police chief stubbed out his cigar. 'The knowledge I have is not necessarily common. I will make no secret of the fact that I came by this information from your son, Claude, and as far as I know he has not mentioned it to anyone else and nor have I.'
'We didn't realise at the time we made the plans that you and Claude were the new owners of the freehold.' I said.
'Obviously, I'm sure you would never have made the plans if you had.
Claude's father said nothing but snorted loudly. 
'Come now gentlemen, I can see by your faces that you do not trust me. I will be the first to admit that we have never been friends as such but this is different - this is business. We islanders must stick together.
'We've never stuck together yet, why should we start now?' Said Claudes father. 'Most people on this Island would stab you in the back as soon as look at you.'
The police chief laughed out loud, almost falling off his chair as it rocked back on two legs. 'That's rich coming from you - the man who tried to shoot me on my wedding day.'
'What!' Gasped Claude's father. I looked up, his jaw dropped almost to his knees and his face wore an expression of shock and embarrassment. I was speechless.
'Did you really think you had me fooled? Do you imagine for one moment that I could rise from the gutter to Police Chief not knowing the difference between a pistol and a cigarette lighter?' He laughed out loud yet again. He laughed so heartily that he had to wipe tears from his eyes. Claude's father and I looked at him in stony silence 'To think, my friend, you had me at the end of a barrel -' He put his hands together to form a gun shape with his fingers. '- this close to my head and "click!" No bullets! Ha ha ha! What frustration you must have felt.'
Claude's father managed to get his jaw to work once more. 'How.....how... did you know, how could you tell? Why did you let me fire the gun if you knew it was real?'
'I could see the chambers were empty of course. You held it so close to my face it was easy to see that it wasn't loaded.'
'But it was loaded.' I managed to blurt out.

I was almost asleep at my junk stall as Toby and Pasha began to quietly chat. It was a balmy evening, quite dusk now. Dust lightly blew across the square from a mild breeze and there was the gentle trickle of water from the fountain and just for a moment or two I felt all was well with the world. Unfortunately this peaceful interlude was spoiled by Claude rushing from the cafe waving a towel above his head and at the very top of his voice yelling ' Fire! Fire! Fire!'
 Toby and Pasha leap to their feet and Toby asks the quite unnecessary question. 'Where?'
'In the cafe you fool, the kitchen in the cafe.' Claude yells.
The importance of the fire is underlined with Toby's charming utterance. 'Oh Gosh!
Claude's face twists into an agonised look. 'Oh gosh! Oh Gosh! Never mind Oh Gosh! Get water, help me put it out.'
 Pasha grabs a bucket from beside my stall. 'I can help.'
'No you can't.' He pushes into her and grabs the bucket for himself. 'You would only get in the way and be no use at all.'
I look up and notice there is smoke coming from Claude's waistcoat. There is a small pocket either side and there is a wisp of smoke curling from one of them. I smile to myself as I yell.  'Fire! Fire! '
'We know there is a fire you old fool.' Pasha almost spits at me. Claude, still clutching his empty bucket turns to me an apologising look on his face as he says hurriedly. 'It is ok my friend I do not expect you to help put it out.'
 'I wasn't intending to.'
'You would be no use anyway old man.' Pasha snarls at me.
'And I was shouting Fire! Claude because there is a fire.'
'I know, I know my friend My kitchen is burning' Claude sobs.
'Oh yes, the kitchen. But I was not referring to the kitchen Claude, that is not the only fire.'
 The sobbing stops for a moment as he looks at me questioningly.
'Your waistcoat Claude. Your waistcoat is also on fire.'
 He looks down, almost as if he had forgotten he was wearing a waistcoat. Then he spotted the spiraling smoke and yelled out
'Whoaaa fire!'
He pats desperately at the pocket till the smoke stops seeping out. He then puts two fingers into the pocket and lets out another ear piercing yell as he burns his fingertips on a cigarette smoldering in the pocket. The cigarette seemed to have attached itself to his fingers and he was trying to shake it off, looking a little like he was trying to swat a wasp.
' The cafe fire Claude' Pasha pleads. 'The kitchen is burning.'
'Yes, yes, yes. I am coming' He yells, once more grabbing the empty bucket. He leaps towards the fountain to collect water but of course the flow stops as soon as he reaches it.
' Why don't you use the water from the kitchen taps Claude.' I ask.
'I am worried I may get burned.'
'Well say goodbye to your cafe then.'
He lets out a loud whimper and cautiously enters the cafe, Pasha and Toby follow close behind. I can hear raised voices, banging and crashing. Smoke is escaping from the cafe window and there is a strong stench of burning fat. There is a lot of shouting and cursing and eventually the smoke coming from the windows diminishes.
 Toby and pasha come back into the Piazza looking bedraggled and spattered with soot stains. The both plonk wearily back onto their seats, Toby wiping his face with an oversized white handkerchief.
I am just about to congratulate the pair on their fire fighting efforts when once more the Police Chief appears. Pasha, Toby and myself are quiet as the Police Chief turns to Pasha.
'Well, well, well my dear. I must say you are looking a little disheveled. I do hope that does not impair your earning capacity.
'It won't.' She snaps back
'I am pleased to hear it. I dropped by to see if Claude has mu coffee ready yet.'
'There has been a fire at the cafe.' Toby explains
'Ahh, I see, I thought maybe you had both been cleaning chimneys. I realise some people have strange sexual tastes. Isn't that right?' He adds, turning to face me.
' I have no idea about tastes sexual or otherwise.'
 'It is gratifying to hear that. Now, where is Claude with my coffee?'
 He bellow's Claudes name and the grubby little man appears almost instantly.
'Ahh Claude. I see you are also looking a little disheveled but I hope that will not delay my coffee any further, I have already missed my usual time.
Claude almost bows. 'No, no there will be no further delay, I will fetch your coffee right now.'
As he turns back towards the door Tobu raise a hand apolgetiacally and asks. 'And can we please have the menu now?'
'The menu! The menu? You do realise there has been a fire here I suppose?
'Well, yes. We helped put it out.'
'In that case please be patient, that has put me a little behind.'
 The Police Chief casually wanders over to my stall.
'Now let me see. Anything more of interest on this pile of Junk?'
He turns to face Toby and Pasha. 'I Say anything more of interest because earlier this evening I bought a rather attractive tie from the old man. Pure silk and only cost me 20. I must say I am really rather pleased with it.'
 I was holding my breath, hoping Toby would keep quiet. My freedom depended on it. The Police Chief slowly extracted the tie from his pocket, almost like a magician.
'You see? A very attractive garment isn't it?'
'Very attractive.' Says Toby quietly. 
'And such a bargain' The Police Chief smiles.
'Err, if it was such a bargain perhaps you would consider letting me purchase it from you – at a profit?'
'You really like it that much?'
'I used to have one just like it but it was -  err, mislaid. It would be nice to replace it.'
I began to panic a little. Toby was on dangerous ground now.
'That was rather careless of you. To mislay such a beautiful tie.'
'These things happen.'
'Yes, of course. Well, let me say I will consider it. I am sure we will meet again sometime and we can discuss it then.'
'That sounds very promising, thank you.'
' I breath a sigh of relief as Claude reappears carrying a tarnished tray with a coffee pot and cup. He places it on a vacant table.
'Ahh at last my coffee has arrived, and not before time.'
'I am sorry for the delay. Today has been a day of difficulties.'
'No matter, it is here now.'
' And do you have the menu for us.' Toby asks a little impatiently.
Claude thumps the table and the coffee pot and cup tremble a little
'YES! YES! I keep telling you it is coming.'
He storms off back into the cafe crashing the door behind him.
The Police Chief pours a coffee, tastes it. And pulls a face even uglier than the normal one
' This Coffee tastes like burnt fat.'

                 <p><center> *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  </center><p>

The Police Chief seems unperturbed. When he hears that the gun was actually loaded.
'Loaded with one bullet, which I understand almost blew poor Claude's head off.'
'It was not quite as bad as that' I say. Not really wanting to discuss the matter further. I ask what business he has to discuss with us.
He takes a long pull on his cigar before answering.
' You have great plans for the Piazza but of course, now the freehold is not available to you, those plans could be scuppered.
 Believe it or not, I would like to help with that.
'You will sell us the freehold you mean? Claude's father asks with almost a sneer.
A long plume of cigar smoke is blown from between The police Chief's thin lips
'Ha ha, oh no nothing quite as simple as that but I am sure we could reach some sort of deal.
'What sort of deal?' I ask pleasantly, not wanting to spoil what could be fortuitous to us.
' You have been very successful in reviving this old shack and I truly believe you could make a success of your new venture. That would be good for the island, and if it is good for the island it is good for me.
'So what are you proposing?' Claude's father asks, a little more politely this time.
'A partnership?' I ask.
'No, not a partnership. I think, considering our pasts, a partnership may be too difficult. After all, you did once try to shoot me.
Claude's father and I say nothing to this, and after a short pause he continues.
' I was thinking more of a rental arrangement. I bought that land with Claude as an investment. As you know, land always increases in value, something for my retirement. Your rental would give me a good income.'
'And we would be able to build on it as we please?' I ask
'Of course, providing planning permission is granted. And I can help you there. I have very good contacts at the planning department.'
'That would be helpful' Says Claude's father. 'So what's the deal?'
' I was thinking in terms of a monthly rental fee of say, hmmm – How about three hundred thousand a month?'
Claude's father let's out a long, low breath. 'That's a lot of money.'
'Not at all, think of the income. Several shops, the nightclub. All of that will be making money for you.'
'I suppose it is possible.' I muse
'There would be one stipulation though, and if this is agreed we can get things in motion as soon as possible.'
'And what is the stipulation?' I ask.
'There would have to be a two year payment in advance.'
'WHAT!!' We both exclaim simultaneously.
'That is absurd.' spits Claude's father.
'It is an awful lot of money.' I add. 'It would almost wipe us out.'
'Wipe you out?' The Police Chief shows, which I can tell, is mock suprise. ' Surely you will need far more than that to carry out the plans you have made.'
' Yes, yes of course we will.' Claude's father thumps the table as he explains. ' Like any enterprise we would need to borrow money from the bank. However the bank is hardly likely to lend us money if we are virtually penniless and your ridiculous scheme of wanting two years in advance would do just about that.
' You must understand though, I need to protect myself.'
'Protect yourself from what?' I ask.
'This is a very ambitious plan you have. Anything could go wrong. I have to make sure I would not be out of pocket.'
Claude's father rises from his chair and pushes it angrily under the table. 'We just would not be able to do it under those circumstances. So this meeting is over'
'Just a minute my friend. Sit back down and let me explain.' Claude's father stands motionless for a moment.
' Come along, sit back down and let's talk business and maybe you will learn something to your advantage,. Come on, sit back down.'
Claude's father begrudgingly pulls the chair once more from the table and sits back down with a thump.
'Good. Now I know that asking for two years in advance may seem a little unfair to you but as I said before, there will be risks to me. However, there are things I can do for you that will be to your great advantage.'
Avoiding eye contact with the Police Chief Claude's father snarls. 'And what is that.'
' I am not without influence in this town. In fact, I have a great deal of influence.
'We know that very well.' I smile
' So let me address some of your concerns. Firstly the problem you feel you may encounter at the bank. Fear not! As you rightly say, in normal circumstances, you would need some collateral or or financial backing. I am sure you would agree this old shack of a cafe would be worth very little?'
'Certainly not enough to finance our plans.' I agree.
'And most of your capital would pay for two years land rental. Which is where I step in. I guarantee the bank will willingly loan you enough for your project.'
'Why on Earth would they do that? Without collateral?' Says Claude's Father.
' Quite simply because I will tell them to.'
'Ha! And that will be enough?'
'More than enough, I promise you.'
 'I must admit it would be a little strange.' I add.
'To you maybe, but not to me. Now your second problem would be the planning department. Now as you may have heard, they can be very difficult to work with.'
'Yes, we have heard.' Answers Claude's father.
'I can make sure you get every type of planning permission you need. I really can make things so easy for you.'
I took a deep breath than asked, quite slowly. 'Why would you do that for us? It is well known that we have always been a long way from being friends.'

'Of course, that is very true. But this isn't about being friends, this is about doing business.' Someday I will have to retire and I want to make sure my retirement will be comfortable. It is as simple as that.'
'We need to think about it.' Claude's father mumbles. ' Talk it over.'
The Police Chief starts to rise. 'Yes of course, understandable. Just let me know when you have reached a decision.'
He started to make for the door but then stopped and turned towards us with a slimy smile on his lips.
'Oh and by the way. I give permission for my wife to continue working here.'
Claude's father and I were speechless as he headed for the door.

The Police chief spits out the coffee and throws the cup to the ground.
' I have never had a coffee that tasted so disgusting.' He turns to leave.
'Tell Claude I will be back in an hour and he'd better have something decent brewed by then.'
 He leaves and the piazza is silent save for the sound of the crickets. I no longer feel drowsy. Every time I see the police chief. I feel anger, frustration and such a sense of doom. I always have.
 Eventually after long moments Toby speaks. 
'Will we ever get the menu?'
' Be patient Toby.' Pasha whispers. Claude has a lot of problems today.'
'He has problems every day.' I quip
'Shut up you miserable old man. And where were you when help was needed to put out the fire?'
' I was here, right here. Which is where I intended to stay.'
'You are no man at all.'
 ' You are probably right.' I agree.
Claude appears with two rather scruffy pieces of paper and passes them to Toby and Pasha.
'Here are the menu's'
Toby looks surprised. ' Ahh thank you.'
' I will be back in a few moments to take your order.'
'Now let me see, what is there to order. Hmm not very much it seems.'
'Just soup for me please.'
'There is soup but it doesn't say what kind.'
'Any kind will do.'
' I rather fancied steak but there doesn't seem to be any.'
'It is a long time since Claude served steak.' I say
'In fact I don't seem to recognise anything on the menu except soup, and no idea what kind that is.'
Pasha says sympathetically. 'I am sure Claude will tell you what the dishes are when he comes back.'
 ' I hope so because I am at a loss.'
I smile. 'I am always at a loss with Claude.'
Pasha scowls at this.  'You are a loss. No use to anyone, not even yourself.
' I cannot argue with that.'
'How could you.'
The still disheveled Claude appears once more.
'Are you ready to order?'
Toby holds up the menu as if Claude has never seen it.
'I am a little confused by some of the items on the menu, could you please tell me exactly what they are?'
' I will try but my English is a little rusty'
Actually his English is very good. He just doesn't like to explain what the menu is.
'This Item here, it says rind. What is that?'
'It is what is says it is. It is rind. Surely you have heard of rind?  Even in England.'
 'I have heard of rind of course but never seen it on a restaurant menu.  What is it the rind of?'
'It is one of our special delicacies. It is the rind of cheeses and bacon served in a tart delightful sauce.'
'Hmm doesn't really sound much of a delicacy.'
 ' It is a popular dish with our more discerning clientele.'
This is too ludicrous to even laugh at.
' Well I am not sure it is for me. What is this one here – Poultice? It sounds awful.'
'It is far from awful. It is one of our most popular dishes.'
'What's in it?'
'I don't have all day to stand here and give you all of my recipes, do you want to eat or not?'
' Ok, no matter, I'll take a chance on the rind dish.'
' And I will have the soup please Claude'
Claude takes a stub of pencil from his filthy waistcoat to write down the order.
'One rind and one soup. Anything to drink?'
'Do you have wine?' Toby asks almost apologetically
' Of course I have wine. This is a restaurant.'
'Do you have a nice Cabernet Sauvignon?'
Claude pushes the pencil stub back into his pocket.
'We have house red or house white'
' House red then please.'
' And I hope it is to your taste sir' Claude grumbles sarcastically as he disappears back into the kitchen.

 We sat in silence for many minutes until I finally said.
'So, what do you think?'
' About what?'
'About anything he said.'
' Well, he knows his wife works here.'
' We did say a while ago he would probably find out somehow.
'Do you think she is safe?'
'Safe?'
'Yes? Safe from him. Do you think he may punish her in some way?'
I thought for a moment.
' I don't think so. It would probably have happened before now if it was going to.'
'I suppose you are right. What did you think of his business idea?'
'Interesting.'
'Huh!! interesting!I would not trust him for one moment, not one.'
'We have to make a decision though. Do we go with him or not?'
There is a long pause. Claude's father stands up slowly moves around to the back of his seat and leans forward, his hands gripping the chair back tightly. He speaks slowly and deliberately.
' I feel if we go into business with this man we will lose everything we have, and everything we have ever worked for. He will do nothing but lie to us and cheat us.'
' I had considered that of course.'
'It is a consideration you should consider very seriously my friend.'
'What are we to do then? If we do not go into business with him we will never be able to buy the piazza. We have no other plans. I have no business at all now and do you want to work in this cafe for the rest of your days?'
There was no answer from him but slowly, once again, he moved around the chair and sat back down, his head bowed between his hands. I thought he may have been tearful. I reached out, gently took his wrists and pulled them slowly towards me before I spoke.
'I am asking you what we should do Gabe, but in all honesty I have no idea myself.'
He looks up, pulls his wrists from my light grip and thumps the table.
'600,000! 600,000! Gone from our account before we have laid one brick.'
'It's an awful lot of money.'
'And what guarantee do we have that he will do as he says? I will tell you what. No guarantee at all. He just wants our money and then it will be goodbye.'
'Maybe not, if we are careful.'
'How can we be careful with a man like that?'
'We get everything legally documented.'
' What kind of lawyer is going to make a legal document for us saying he will blackmail the bank and planning department? Because that is what he will do. He does not have influence as he says. He has threats.'
'There is something in what you say.'
'There is everything in what I say.'
' So what are we to do?'
'I don't know. I just don't know.'
' I am not saying it is an easy decision but I somehow feel we should take a chance.'
'It would be a hell of a chance my friend.'
At that moment our 'Muaricio' appeared at the bottom of the stairs.
' He has gone I see.'
Gabe looked around at her.
'Yes he has gone my dear.'
'Was he really awful? you look so sad.'
 He tried a smile.
'Actually he was very pleasant. A bit too pleasant for my liking.'
'And mine.' I added
' He offered us a business deal and we are making considerations.'
'Ohh, that is why you are looking sad. You think he will cheat you?'
I was about to reply but Gabe beat me to it.
'I am pretty damn sure he will cheat us.'
She moved towards him then placed her hands on his shoulders. In a very affectionate way.
' I think you are right. I think he will lie to you and cheat you, just like he does me. He cannot be trusted to any degree'
She then did something that surprised me. Completely unexpected. She moved around the chair and eased herself onto Gabe's lap. I think there must have been a complete look of surprise on my face but Gabe did not look surprised at all. Her arm went around his neck and her head rested against his chest. 
'Don't do it, if there is any other way do not go into business with him. I beg you.'  
I looked at them. More than a little confused. Had it happened before? They looked so comfortable together.

Toby and Pasha wait patiently for the food, silence between them.
 I look across at the old cafe and remember how it used to be with laughing, singing crowds. Fine food and fine wine. Music of one sort or another, couples dancing and the sound of constant, yes constant laughter. It almost brings a tear to my eye. The cafe is now in a bad state of disrepair, Claude spends nothing on it. The piazza's paving stones are riddled with cracks giving way to the weeds pushing up between them and the walls are damaged and in reality, in danger of falling. Earlier I was finding it hard to stay awake. Now I would like to sleep and forget everything but the sleep won't come. Toby drums his fingers on the table impatiently as pasha inspects her fingernails. What a far cry from what I remember. I am wondering what will arrive first. The meals that were ordered or the police chief for his coffee. It is no concern of mine which comes first but bu thought was answered as Claude bustled out of the cafe carrying two dishes.
'Here is your food. One rind and one soup.'
'And the wine?' Toby inquires.
' Yes, yes the wine is coming. Be patient I have to do everything on my own.'
He disappears back into the cafe and returns a few mioments later with a carafe of red wine and two glasses. They are plonked on the table without ceremony and he retreats once more without a word.
Toby pours the wine and they toast each other. Toby then looks very disapprovingly towards his dish.

                  *********************************

 When we are young do we ever think about getting old? Gabe and I didn't. Even when sadness descended upon us we thought we may have eternal youth.
